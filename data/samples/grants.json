The general solution to this is widely known - just throw uniqueness at it! However, the current leading solutions to prove \"uniqueness\" come with an equally negative tradeoff: privacy. Every current attempt at solving this problem, although they are incredible steps forward, either require your crypto identity to be publicized, can be purchased, or are centralized in some way. Even Gitcoin has the best integrations to provide quadratic funding, with these exact problems:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need a public good to solve this.\r\n\r\nProof of Residency is a \"proof of personhood\" protocol which aims to solve identity on the blockchain while retaining privacy - we issue non-transferable ERC-721's using physical mail. Privacy is the first priority - addresses are kept completely private and off-chain, real names are not requested, and any unique data is provably kept secret. To add to that, decentralization and community ownership are built into the protocol.\r\n\r\nWe pride ourselves in maintaining anonymity in our design - there are no other proof of personhood protocols that allow DAO participants to remain anonymous while allowing them to participate in novel governance methods like quadratic voting. We believe the future of on-chain governance depends on privacy-retaining, provable uniqueness.\r\n\r\nFunding Uses\r\n\r\nAs of today, all of the maintenance and infrastructure cost has been subsidized by the developers behind the project. We have resisted any funding from sources that don't match our goals, so we can focus on building a public good for Ethereum and it's L2s. In order to begin forming a decentralized community around this project, we have turned to Gitcoin.\r\n\r\nWe have built and deployed our beta dApp to Arbitrum One in three months - we can only imagine the community we will build with more time and resources. We will use the funding to continue to grow and support the ecosystem, and progressively decentralize.\r\n\r\nAmong our top priorities are conducting another smart contract audit, deploying to Mainnet/all remaining L2s, expanding ecosystem awareness, and building out a suite of features to support the organizations which adopt our product.\r\n\r\nWith community support, we can then scale our system to use machine learning to detect fraudulent activity based on on-chain data, and evolve our UI to better protect against Sybil attacks.\r\n\r\nOutro\r\n\r\nWe are proud of the work we've done so far - check out our whitepaper for details on the existing system and our future roadmap.

A vision merging both ecological beekeeping and blockchain development. An eco friendly beekeeper's house in the forest and a cultural DAO house on the blockchain. Like in a beehive, where every bee has an essential role, the Seigr Huset DAO aims to be a community driven cultural referent where every member of the community has an essential role.\r\nNot only will Seigr Huset locally deliver a common good with its ecological beekeeping, but by community driven development will the DAO deliver both open source tools and stream cultural events to the whole world.

With this data we can also have a better understanding about the climate crisis impact on honeybees and act consequently to improve their wellbeing.\r\n\r\nDAO's rooms\r\n\r\nThe beekeeper's room: Although this is the beekeepers’ room it will be open to everyone in the community. A room where we can discuss about beekeeping and everything about the fascinating bees. All shared knowledge will be digitally available. This material will also be used in the labs for both creating open source tools and games.\r\nThe lab: The lab is an essential room for the DAO. Not only is from this room that the DAO is technically maintained and expanded as needed, this is the room where the developers and the community can work on new open source tools. Here we can experiment and find solutions to mutual problems. Develop tools that will help beekeepers, artists and the whole community. It is also from this room that games will be created. These games aim to spread knowledge about nature in an exciting way. \r\nThe workshop: The house in the forest will hold workshops and talks that will be available for all the Seigr Huset DAO community. The workshops will mainly be about bees and beekeeping, but also about ecology, art, health and open source projects. Seigr Huset wants also to collaborate with local schools and offer introduction courses for children. All courses will be available for the community members so everyone can learn at their own pace.\r\nThe NFTs room: This will be the community’s own gallery and NFT marketplace. This room will be open to everyone, a room to show the world all the awesome works created by the community. \r\nThe governance room: This is DAO’s most important room. Seigr Huset is a firm believer in decentralized governance and sees this as a fundamental part of its core beliefs and strategy. Seigr Huset is governed by its community; improvement proposals come from the Seigr Huset’s community via discussions and feedback provided by all stakeholders. Improvement Proposals are then held and voted on.\r\nThe safe room: It is important to have a secure and transparent economy. The safe will be the room where all token holders can check out everything related to the DAO’s economy.\r\nThe forum: This is the room for the community to discussion and hold conversations about everything related to the DAO.\r\n\r\nThe team\r\n\r\nI, Sergi Saldaña Massó, am an interdisciplinary artist and beekeeper in love with bees and the forest. I am a small scala producer of forest honey. Last December I bought a cabin in the woods, this cabin is the base of the Seigr Huset DAO. All decisions taken in the DAO will have a direct effect on the physical house and the new beehives established there.\r\nBack in the 90s I worked in Barcelona translating and developing interactive CD-ROMs (testing, designing, programming and sound editing). I got a sound engineer degree in the late 90s. I do also have experience as graphic designer and digital printing. \r\nIn 2004 I moved to Norway, got an Art Direction degree and became a forest beekeeper.

Once certified, participants can apply to several social protection programs. Every program will publish clear criteria for eligibility, entry, and exit, and transparent mechanisms for establishing benefits levels. A combination of Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Schelling Points will be applied to incentivize social workers (Certifiers) to do a good job. \r\n\r\nPOI stands out from other programs because it goes to the root of poverty, that is, directly addressing the urgent needs of the poor, and connecting them directly with the sources of help; people with wealth and professionals of social assistance, all this on a global scale, leaving no one out.","reference_url":"https://www.proofofintegrity.org/","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/a493435a991368d6c14b95ac2375a39e/logo.jpg","admin_address":"0xa7dDa301970378Bb12c28C4214CdFdB6fe44636C","amount_received":"5.1752","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any Token","contract_address":"0x0","metadata":{"gem":-105689999,"related":[[12,2],[4573,1],[4352,1],[4287,1],[4268,1],[4165,1],[4027,1]],"upcoming":-99997500,"wall_of_love":[],"last_calc_time_related":1645366560.0963674,"last_calc_time_contributor_counts":1645385934.0727708,"last_calc_time_sybil_and_contrib_amounts":1645385934.8020072},"network":"mainnet","required_gas_price":"0","admin_profile":{"id":336778,"url":"/michocohen","name":"Michel Cohen","handle":"michocohen","keywords":[],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/509fc2504154d7d805c3ad76d16db657/michocohen.png","github_url":"https://github.com/michocohen","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}},"team_members":[{"id":336778,"url":"/michocohen","name":"Michel Cohen","handle":"michocohen","keywords":[],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/509fc2504154d7d805c3ad76d16db657/michocohen.png","github_url":"https://github.com/michocohen","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}},{"id":336785,"url":"/lucianobracco-beon-studio","name":"Luciano Bracco","handle":"lucianobracco-beon-studio","keywords":[],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/5ed55759e59cebf5194af8a85a6974c2/lucianobracco-beon-studio.png","github_url":"https://github.com/lucianobracco-beon-studio","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}},{"id":336787,"url":"/nicoayala","name":"Nico","handle":"nicoayala","keywords":["Shell","JavaScript","Ruby","PHP"],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/13d48966007761a48653531b6d3e37d6/nicoayala.png","github_url":"https://github.com/nicoayala","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}},{"id":341531,"url":"/dmazzitelli2013","name":"dmazzitelli2013","handle":"dmazzitelli2013","keywords":["Shell","PHP","SourcePawn","Swift","Objective-C"],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/ce5796632b6a2b3976cadde199f6d0d6/dmazzitelli2013.png","github_url":"https://github.com/dmazzitelli2013","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}}],"clr_prediction_curve":[[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0]],"clr_round_num":"","is_clr_active":false,"amount_received_in_round":"5.1752","positive_round_contributor_count":1,"clr_matches":[],"logo_url":["https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/a493435a991368d6c14b95ac2375a39e/logo.jpg"],"details_url":"/grants/4597/proof-of-integrity"},{"id":4592,"active":true,"title":"Decentralized Reputation Engine","slug":"decentralized-reputation-engine","description":"Hey everyone!\n\nWe’re excited to announce our first ever Gitcoin Grant application.\n\nWhat is Ourspace?\n\nOurspace is the reputation engine. In web2, we need to find great information, so search engines rate websites. web3, we need trustworthy people, and we need reputation engines. ourspace calculates the social connections of all major web3 social networks to get a reputation value for each user. It is Anti-Sybil, AI-resistant, quantifiable and decentralized. You can find more information on the official website of Ourspace.\n\nWhy Gitcoin Grants?\n\nOver the past year, we have been testing social network data in Circles and optimizing the algorithm. The fully decentralized reputation system is practically complete and has been funded by the Web Foundation. Now we want to extend our reputation system to all web3 social networks.That's not really accurate, because it's not us, it's me. I've been working as a core developer/marketing/UI etc. I actually majored in marketing and taught myself to program because of my interest in web3.\n\nI spent a lot of time and effort on Ourspace. I turned down some investments, Ourspace is a very important but long journey and I don't want to be distracted by investors.And there will be more to do in 2022, I need to expand the team. We will be supporting social networks like RSS3 / Revery and BitClout one after another. And in the process gather more feedback and optimize the algorithm again.The end result is an unprecedented experience for every Web3 user.\n\nUsing Ourspace we can:\n\nGet greater voting power\nGet more airdrops\nYou can play with humans instead of bots\nTake out a loan in our upcoming Minsky Bank, and the higher your reputation the higher your credit limit. What's even more exciting is that Minsky Bank allows for negative interest rates, meaning that if you loan money to the bank, the bank will pay you interest. Interest rates are adjusted in real time on every transaction. We'll go explore solutions to the financial crisis.\n\n\n\n","reference_url":"https://ourspace.network/","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/c4dc3e94ec2e17d23704c719d8b49640/full-logo.png","admin_address":"0xEBCDa7c73EB5Dd7a4314cFf395bE07EB1E24c046","amount_received":"1.0000","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any Token","contract_address":"0x0","metadata":{"gem":-105998999,"related":[[3414,1],[12,1]],"upcoming":-100018500,"wall_of_love":[],"last_calc_time_related":1645366558.8498504,"last_calc_time_contributor_counts":1645385830.6308763,"last_calc_time_sybil_and_contrib_amounts":1645385831.5066986},"network":"mainnet","required_gas_price":"0","admin_profile":{"id":326149,"url":"/darkinglee","name":"DarkingLee","handle":"darkinglee","keywords":["Rust"],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/3b86e5a8c9149e40ee33fa2934b66e02/darkinglee.png","github_url":"https://github.com/darkinglee","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}},"team_members":[{"id":326149,"url":"/darkinglee","name":"DarkingLee","handle":"darkinglee","keywords":["Rust"],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/3b86e5a8c9149e40ee33fa2934b66e02/darkinglee.png","github_url":"https://github.com/darkinglee","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}}],"clr_prediction_curve":[[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0]],"clr_round_num":"","is_clr_active":false,"amount_received_in_round":"1.0000","positive_round_contributor_count":1,"clr_matches":[],"logo_url":["https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/c4dc3e94ec2e17d23704c719d8b49640/full-logo.png"],"details_url":"/grants/4592/decentralized-reputation-engine"},{"id":4589,"active":true,"title":"Chocomint","slug":"chocomint","description":"What is Chocomint ?\r\n\r\n  Chocomint is a decentralized multi-chain NFTs platform.

The average web2 user gets no monetary benefit or stake in the platform they use. Big Tech is taking our data and selling it for their own profit. Is this fair? We at DATALATTE think not. We believe in a fair data economy where data producers are in control of their data and they can choose to sell it or not. We aim to challenge the status quo and empower everyone so that they can benefit from their data, not big tech companies. Together, we can reclaim our digital human rights.\r\n\r\nValues - transparency, equality, community\r\nOur protocol is open source to be verified and audited. Our users will see any single interaction with their data and will receive the benefit.\r\nOur NFTokenomics treats any user as a stakeholder in our business model because they benefit from the marketplace revenue directly. Read more about our equality and communize factor in our NFTokenomics lightpaper.\r\nOur community is the only thing that can support us against tech monopolies. Without our community, we can not challenge the system and resist the backlash from the big tech. This is a data revolution and we fight together.\r\n\r\nData barista NFTs\r\nTo welcome our users and include them into our business model, 101 data baristas were minted to our early 101 users in return for them uploading their NetflixViewingHistory.csv.

Discourse to web3","slug":"moving-discourse-to-web3","description":"Moving Discourse to web3\r\nWhat is Discourse?\r\nDiscourse is the most widely used open source community software. What WordPress did to blogging, Discourse is doing to community software. It is a tool that non technical people can use to build communities.\r\nBut also many big companies like Roblox or Figma use Discourse to connect with their customers. Even companies like Twitter , Github and Amazon use it to host their developer and support forums.\r\nThere are also many communities in the cryptocurrency space that use Discourse: Metacartel, Makerdao and the ethresear.ch forum just to name a few.\r\nIt is possible to build custom themes and plugins for Discourse, so there is a lot of potential for experimentation and differentiation.\r\nFor example I experimented with a projects management plugin: https://meta.discourse.org/t/projects-management-plugin/143712\r\nI also built the actually useful math equations plugin :-): https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-math-editor-user-friendly-equations/149363\r\n\r\nWhat needs to be done?\r\nRight now, user accounts in Discourse are tied to emails and passwords. The first step is to replace this with \"Sign-in with Ethereum\"\r\nThis should already unlock a lot of potential, because all the 10.000s of Discourse installs will be able to turn themselves into a web3 project.\r\nIt also enables someone who is not that technical to prototype web3 ideas. In the same way that WordPress enabled so much experimentation on the web, this can enable experimentation with web3 on a much larger scale.\r\nThe next step will be to see what people build and help them with further modifications.\r\nThere are many directions we can go with this: the classics like NFT profile pictures and ENS usernames are just the start. There are many usecases that we didnt even begin to explore properly. Building online marketplaces on the traditional banking system is practical impossible for a lay person. It is very easy to enable customers to send money, but very hard to get them to receive payouts back. All of these things are possible now because of the decentralized, permissionless nature of cryptocurrencies.\r\nIf we truly want to unlock the potential hidden behind these attributes we need to drastically lower the barrier to entry when it comes to building experiments with web3.\r\nWeb3 is all about building communities. So we need to make it easy to prototype community software that has web3 login and other features built in. Online communities all build on the same types of features: being able to post things, comment on things, make all of this content searchable - user accounts and groups (some of which may be private). We need to provide these basic features for people to play with.\r\nDiscourse comes from the tradition of forum and BBS software but adds some user interface improvements that were made in the social network era. So it is only logical to use Discourse as a basis for this endeavor.\r\n\r\nHow will this be implemented?\r\nThe functionality will be split into smaller, composable Discourse plugins. The first one will be the \"Sign-in with Ethereum\" plugin. It is the first building block that everything else builds upon.\r\nAfterwards we can branch out into NFTs, gamification and marketplace features.\r\nThe focus should be on what people want to experiment with and what holds the most potential.

Being able to verify belt rank certificates, tournament victories/attendance, training time, and more provide key information not previously available. NFTs can also be used for coupons that cannot be forged and other marketing campaigns. \r\n\r\nThe supply of people able to code these contracts is much less than the demand, which is why we created this free tool to allow people to generate their own NFT collections without writing a single line of code. Users can deploy new contracts with one click, edit the types of NFTs they wish to issue, and issue NFTs. There is a web front end for managing the NFTs and NFTs can list directly on Opensea. \r\n\r\nWhile the examples and front end is designed for martial arts schools, anyone can generate their own NFTs with this tool. There is also admin control so that the contract deployers can designate staff to be able to mint different types of NFTs. \r\n\r\nThe web app by default will deploy to polygon, but uses can easily change a few lines of code to deploy on Ethereum mainnet or any EVM compatible chain. \r\n\r\nWhy Gitcoin? \r\n\r\nThis project was designed as a free and open source public good.

Services currently include smart contract creation and auditing, safety ratings, Web3 site creation, and due-diligence for the Web3 ecosystem. We use intelligent UI/UX to create user friendly interfaces and elegant onboarding ramps for blockchain interaction. Safety and security should be at the heart of all platforms, especially public goods services, which is why we are passionate about helping smaller projects who otherwise couldn’t afford such technical support. The team aims to use its knowledge to give back to the Ethereum and wider Web3 community.\r\n\r\nA full list of services includes:\r\nSmart Contract Auditing │Safety Rating │Due-diligence\r\nSmart Contract creation ( all standards )\r\nWeb3 platform creation │Websites creation\r\nPlatform integration │Decentralised App creation\r\nTokenomics Analysis │Dapp Architecture\r\nPromotion / Advertising & Marketing\r\n\r\nThe White Hat DAO Journey\r\nAfter a BanklessDAO AMA with Copper Launch (Alchemist), the White Hat DAO genesis team was presented with the opportunity to create a token launch rating system. The need for proper due-diligence has never been greater, especially with so many communities looking to either launch a token or invest in one. The burgeoning NFT community is also rife with rug pulls and poorly written contracts. With the creation of White Hat DAO, it is our goal to provide so much more than just a rating system. By creating a safe and trusted environment where people can both enlist services and also learn about security, the team believes it is preparing the public for a more secure and safe life on the blockchain.\r\n\r\nWhy Gitcoin Grants? \r\nGitcoin Grants is at the forefront of supporting open source and public goods projects. White Hat DAO aims to offer discounted services for projects that embody these characteristics. Funding from Gitcoin Grants would assist in that effort, thereby strengthening the Web3 ecosystem.\r\n\r\nHow Funds Will be Used\r\nInitial funding will go towards the creation of the White Hat DAO and it's products & services. This includes website creation (currently just a landing page), maintaining a ratings list, and compensating developers for work done on public goods sites. Development is currently taking place on a list of eligible public good sites, and what services they would qualify for.\r\n\r\nPublic Goods Clients\r\nhttps://www.defipedia.io\r\nTalent DAO\r\n\r\nImpact \r\nSupporting Web3 clients with strong security as a baseline will not only help their projects succeed, but will also protect users (the public) from falling victim to poorly written code.\r\n\r\nContributors\r\nAdmin + Development Advisor: White Hat#6398\r\nAdmin + Community Advisor: NFThinker🏴#2814\r\nFull Stack Dev: - dsine#1867\r\nFull Stack Dev:

How did this happen?\r\n\r\nMaybe, your wallet app has 530 dependencies, and one particular dependency that colorized text - got hacked, which allowed an adversary to infiltrate the supply chain and send your mnemonics to their domain?\r\n\r\nPerhaps, something is wrong with secp256k1 cryptographic primitive, that your wallet uses to sign all transactions. It generated repeated nonces, which allowed an attacker to restore your private key by simply looking at two transactions of yours?\r\n\r\nIt may be that a password-protected wallet file that you’ve been storing on your computer used a PBKDF2 with only 1000 iterations, that allowed a thief to brute-force it in less than 96 hours using a bunch of cheap S3 servers.\r\n\r\nYou may blame a developer of a web3 site you’ve been visiting, or your wallet’s developer, but auditing all dependencies is a no-simple task. Moreover, re-auditing all of them on every update is even harder.\r\n\r\nAre supply chain attacks real?\r\nTotally. Consider these examples:\r\n\r\n1. Reputable developer giving project rights to a rogue developer in a good faith (event-stream example)\r\n2. Reputable developer getting hacked and having a bad package published\r\n3. Rogue developer creating new project, waiting for it to become popular and pushing a bad version after that (electron-native-notify example)\r\n4. Developer corrupts an existing, popular project (colors example)\r\n\r\nThere are tons of actors who wish to push their malware into a popular system like NPM.\r\n\r\nWhat am I working on\r\nTo improve security, i’m developing low-level libraries that don’t use other libraries, or use them minimally.\r\n\r\nSo-called zero/minimal-dependency approach works pretty well — if someone feels like reading the whole dependency tree, it can be done pretty easily. All releases are signed with PGP keys.\r\n\r\nNoble also serves as a great learning resource for cryptography beginners: the code is well-written and can be understood by non-cryptographers. I also write blog posts (example) that describe their internals.\r\n\r\nMoreover, even though the main focus of libraries is security, many of them hold the title of  fastest JS libraries for their purpose. So they’re not just secure, they’re lightning fast. Which could allow your device to render those 120FPS animations without a fear of dropped frames.\r\n\r\n- noble-secp256k1: RFC6979 deterministic ECDSA, BIP0340 Schnorr signatures, ECDH\r\nThat's the one that allows you to handle private/public keys\r\nAny time you're signing a transaction (ETH/token/NFT/DEX etc...), you're using secp256k1\r\nMaking it secure is crucial\r\nAlso used in BTC\r\n- noble-ed25519: RFC8032 EDDSA, RFC7748 X25519, ristretto255 prime-order group\r\nTLS (aka HTTPS browsing), Signal, TOR, SSH use it extensively\r\n- noble-bls12-381: threshold signatures and pairings usable by zk-SNARKs\r\nETH2 beacon chain consensus layer uses it all the time\r\nYour ETH2 staking keys are secured by it\r\n- noble-hashes: SHA2, SHA3, RIPEMD, BLAKE2/3, HMAC, HKDF, PBKDF2 & Scrypt\r\nUsed all over ETH apps\r\nETH addresses use SHA3 (keccak)\r\nPBKDF2/Scrypt secure your wallets\r\nAudited, 0 vulnerabilities have been found\r\n- ethereum-cryptography: every cryptographic primitive needed to work on Ethereum, for the browser and Node.js and its submodules — all audited\r\n  - 341,000 weekly downloads, used in all sorts of popular ETH apps\r\n  - base - base64, base58, bech32 and others\r\n  - bip32 - hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets\r\n  - bip39 - mnemonic phrases.

This is where Road2Crypto comes in.\r\n \r\nWhy a Gitcoin Grant?\r\nWe'll be using 100% of this Gitcoin grant to fund the development of the project. As of now there is only 1 developer working on it in the midnight hours after a full day of work, this grant would allow to speed up the iOS features and port it to Android by hiring new devs. The project is now self-funded. Proper funding would increase the development speed dramatically.\r\n \r\nHow does this deliver value to the ecosystem?\r\n \r\nDownloading & using the app is free. The project adds enormous value by presenting the different blockchains data to the user in a beautiful, elegant and useful way. For instance: Let's say I invest in AAVE and Compound in Polygon to earn interest on my deposits and borrow money against them, but I also like to use AVAX and Solana for NFTs, by Road2Crypto merging all these data together and presenting it to the user with important summaries such as current debt, pending rewards to claim, set a limit for when the investment should be sold, for example after 10x and more in a simple page the user can have an understanding of what's going on without to manually having to track all these things in an excel sheet.\r\n \r\nThe goal of the project is to advance crypto adoption and help the common user while doing it by facilitating easy tools to track all this, for example track projects which the users is interested in but have not released yet or allow the transfer of assets without compromising the security (asking for private keys)\r\n \r\nHow does the project work?\r\nRoad2Crypto is a cross-platform app, as of now it supports iOS and iPadOS with real-time sync function (one of the goals of this fund raising is to hire a dev for Android).\r\nWhen you enter into the app you put your Public address and it indexes several blockchains to find all the data and present it to the user in a useful and beautiful way.\r\n \r\nWhat have we achieved since then?\r\n \r\nThe project released in October 2021. In only 3 months we've accomplished a lot by working endless hours!\r\n \r\nA small summary of what we have developed since then below:\r\nCoins listing with historical data\r\nMulti-wallet support\r\nAutomatic Token detection\r\nNew update notification screen to inform users\r\nAdded filter to exclude (but still show) non verified tokens\r\nPrivacy options in case the user needs to show their portfolio\r\nLight/Dark themes\r\nMulti-chain (Ethereum, Polygon, Binance, Avalanche, Moonriver)\r\nMulti Currency support\r\nReal time prices\r\nReal time inflow/outflow of Transactions (this was temp. removed but still works in the backend just not being used. It’ll eventually be used to calculate the average of the investments and more)\r\nHide coins with small amount (up to the user to decide the amount)\r\n\r\nSome upcoming features we are excited about:\r\nIndexing more blockchains such as Polkadot, Cardano, Atom, Fantom, Axie Infinity and many more!\r\nAdding option to add manually your portfolio without the need to give your public wallet address.\r\nConnecting exchanges to the app such as Kucoin or Coinbase in a secure way that doesn’t compromises the user’s security such as asking for private keys.\r\nNFTs… this is a big one, the idea is to make it easy and enjoyable to see them while proving real time important information.\r\n\r\nThose are just some of the basic features planned for the next releases.\r\nIf you like what we are doing and want to help us achieve our mission you can donate as much you want via this Grant. Even 1 USDC counts. \r\nAll funds we get from this grant will go towards development of features for Road2Crypto.

This is convenient because there is only one address that is being used but the disadvantage is that since the blockchain is public, anyone can track an address and the information associated to it, especially the cryptocurrency balance in the address. This method of address reuse is not private as all your balances are being held in a single address.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that since an address has a corresponding private key, and Ethereum wallets uses one private key to store all the cryptocurrencies, the cryptocurrencies in the wallet can be stolen easily by a hacker.\r\n\r\nSure, a user can keep changing wallets but not only is this inefficient (due to the need to be able to keep track of all of the coins and tokens, as well as importing every address to move the cryptocurrencies), it is also cost efficient due to the fact that there is a high cost in moving all of the cryptocurrencies in all of the wallets. The UTXO smart contract wallet is meant to address this issue by allowing one address to keep track of many addresses (in the contract) and only need one transaction to move all of the funds in all of the contracts (like Bitcoin).\r\n\r\nThe UTXO smart contract wallet addresses this problem by utilizing:\r\nUTXO - Change addresses with each transaction, both sending and receiving, allowing for a more private wallet\r\nSmart Contract - More flexibility in making a wallet, and it is a way to make sure that a wallet is secure as only the contract owner (the one who has the private key or keys) can move the funds\r\nMultisignature - Making a wallet more secure by enabling more than one owner to own the smart contract wallet\r\n\r\nThis is still in planning and research stage as more information is needed to create such a wallet. As a student who is passionate about this project which was born from a school project, I would want to make this project a reality as I believe that many people can benefit from this UTXO smart contract wallet in the future as there will be more people adopting cryptocurrencies, and both security and privacy in wallets will be expected to be in huge demand in the future.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\n17 Feb 2022:\r\n\r\n\t\tGitcoin Grants Round 13 details can be found here\r\n","reference_url":"https://www.publish0x.com/utxo-smart-contract-wallet","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/212899712578c667a5eb36f842ee0f20/zX405Jv.jpeg","admin_address":"0xcCfE8D88074fc8Cd33B93c7d7e03CA4D8Dd3512C","amount_received":"0.0000","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any Token","contract_address":"0x0","metadata":{"gem":-112000000,"related":[],"upcoming":-100040000,"wall_of_love":[],"last_calc_time_related":1645366569.7243812,"last_calc_time_contributor_counts":1645385814.8999162,"last_calc_time_sybil_and_contrib_amounts":1645385814.9039683},"network":"mainnet","required_gas_price":"0","admin_profile":{"id":213833,"url":"/liquid-glass","name":"Liquid-Glass","handle":"liquid-glass","keywords":[],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/24914c790af0af21cf09816d53db1e58/liquid-glass.png","github_url":"https://github.com/liquid-glass","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}},"team_members":[{"id":213833,"url":"/liquid-glass","name":"Liquid-Glass","handle":"liquid-glass","keywords":[],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/24914c790af0af21cf09816d53db1e58/liquid-glass.png","github_url":"https://github.com/liquid-glass","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}}],"clr_prediction_curve":[[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0]],"clr_round_num":"","is_clr_active":false,"amount_received_in_round":"0.0000","positive_round_contributor_count":0,"clr_matches":[],"logo_url":["https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/212899712578c667a5eb36f842ee0f20/zX405Jv.jpeg"],"details_url":"/grants/4513/utxo-smart-contract-wallet"},{"id":4511,"active":true,"title":"Governor DAO Proof of Existence - Solved Sybil Resistance","slug":"governor-dao-proof-of-existence-solved-sybil-resi","description":"DONATIONS FOR THE GDAO GRANT ARE FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES ONLY\r\nDO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING IN RETURN\r\nTHIS IS NOT A SALE\r\n\r\n\r\nProof-of-Existence is a first-of-its-kind innovation in sybil resistance, which addresses the decade-long dilemma of \"how do I build decentralized systems designed for one account per user if I can't vet the accounts?\" \r\n\r\nIn other words, if you design your contract/emissions/token launch/consensus model around the notion that everyone gets one account, how do you stop people from using multiple accounts?\r\n\r\nThe original answer, pioneered by Bitcoin and Proof-of-Work, is to make weight-based systems: the more hashrate you provide, the more BTC you earn. This model is permissable in some instances (yet rarely optimal). Uncapped, performance-based POW has resulted in an increasingly energy inefficient, expensive consensus model.\r\n\r\nIn yield farms and governance voting, it means whales dominate the game and small accounts have virtually no say. In token sales and NFT mints, it means users are competing in gas wars against bots and multi-account participants.\r\n\r\nThe only widely use defense today against multi-account and bot abuse is KYC, which has a separate set of baggage. Proof-of-Existence is the first easy-to-integrate, non-intrusive, 100% effective, universal defense against sybil attacks.\r\n\r\nHow it Works\r\nGovernor DAO, in partnership with leading biometrics firm Finnovant, have created a portal for biometric authentication of Ethereum wallets. Users enter the portal with a web3 connected wallet and input face + voice readings. Locally, the user device runs the input information through hundreds of algorithmic indicators to create an encrypted output hash representing the individual.\r\n\r\nNo two individuals produce the same output hash, and Governor DAO receives the hash that corresponds with the input address. If the hash is unique from all others in the system, the address is tokenized as \"provably unique\". A non-transferrable ERC20 \"Proof of Existence\" token is attached to the user wallet, which enables any smart contract to easily check for that verifiable uniqueness with just one additional line of code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Team\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDONATIONS FOR THE GDAO GRANT ARE FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES ONLY\r\nDO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING IN RETURN\r\nTHIS IS NOT A SALE\r\n\r\n\r\n","reference_url":"https://governordao.org","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/b89242909f1531ae76abab7b0b3adc48/VoteIcon_2.png","admin_address":"0xc597b10eB4DBabA8c6a887792b60AabcBF27e076","amount_received":"0.0000","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any Token","contract_address":"0x0","metadata":{"gem":-112300000,"related":[],"upcoming":-100041000,"wall_of_love":[],"last_calc_time_related":1645366568.2378151,"last_calc_time_contributor_counts":1645385889.794722,"last_calc_time_sybil_and_contrib_amounts":1645385889.7982686},"network":"mainnet","required_gas_price":"0","admin_profile":{"id":155753,"url":"/0xjonholdscrypto","name":"Jon Greenwood","handle":"0xjonholdscrypto","keywords":["solidity"," evm"," dapps"," blockchains"," web3js"," ethersjs"," corda"," layer2"," integrations"," "],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/fa3a3a2508ca0dc7888336a37db4ea21/0xjonholdscrypto.png","github_url":"https://github.com/0xjonholdscrypto","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}},"team_members":[{"id":155753,"url":"/0xjonholdscrypto","name":"Jon Greenwood","handle":"0xjonholdscrypto","keywords":["solidity"," evm"," dapps"," blockchains"," web3js"," ethersjs"," corda"," layer2"," integrations"," "],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/fa3a3a2508ca0dc7888336a37db4ea21/0xjonholdscrypto.png","github_url":"https://github.com/0xjonholdscrypto","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}},{"id":304934,"url":"/green-jeff","name":"Green Jeff","handle":"green-jeff","keywords":[],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/fdd9c7a81077f8ea5ded157dd75f4da5/green-jeff.png","github_url":"https://github.com/green-jeff","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}},{"id":335748,"url":"/sidewindergdao","name":"SideWinder","handle":"sidewindergdao","keywords":[],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/f6fbcd0c20f110cc18e9ce78c47da29a/sidewindergdao.png","github_url":"https://github.com/sidewindergdao","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}},{"id":335749,"url":"/frenchiecoin","name":"frenchiecoin","handle":"frenchiecoin","keywords":[],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/b4faf8286adb17e3ea8edc82f42e033e/frenchiecoin.png","github_url":"https://github.com/frenchiecoin","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}}],"clr_prediction_curve":[[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0]],"clr_round_num":"","is_clr_active":false,"amount_received_in_round":"0.0000","positive_round_contributor_count":0,"clr_matches":[],"logo_url":["https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/b89242909f1531ae76abab7b0b3adc48/VoteIcon_2.png"],"details_url":"/grants/4511/governor-dao-proof-of-existence-solved-sybil-resi"},{"id":4503,"active":true,"title":"Osmotic Funding","slug":"osmotic-funding","description":"Osmotic Funding is a protocol built on top of Conviction Voting to create and regulate project funding streams based on the interest a community has in them.

However, this exposes patients to serious health risks: suppressing the immune system to treat autoimmune diseases leaves patients vulnerable to infections, which can be life-threatening and even cause death.   \r\n \r\nDespite the pharmaceutical industry constantly going back to the trough of drugs that in some way suppress the immune system, we have evidence that a compound already found in the body, called sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), does treat autoimmune diseases without suppressing the immune system; thus extending and improving the quality of life for those with autoimmune disease conditions. \r\n \r\nProof of effectiveness\r\n \r\nA study has shown that S1P treats psoriasis without suppression of the immune system (DOI: 10.1016/j.jdermsci.2013.03.006), while in another study, S1P has demonstrated the ability to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in amounts that do not suppress the immune system (WHO ID: wpr-652060). Keep in mind that the amount is important. For example, clean water is not inherently bad or dangerous to drink, but one must have the right amount of water; too little water causes dehydration (bad) and too much water causes hyperhydration (water intoxication – also bad). The crucial factor is the amount. The amount of S1P given to treat RA does not suppress the immune system. \r\n \r\nProject Aims\r\n \r\nWe have concluded all the heavy-lifting with the culmination of a U.S. Patent being granted for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by S1P in amounts that do not suppress the immune system. To take advantage of this U.S. Patent, we need to carry-out what is known as pre-clinical trials to prove to the FDA that S1P is safe to use in the public before moving on to clinical trials. We believe this process shall be fairly straight-forward since S1P is already in the body (just not in the amounts to elicit autoimmune disease treatment – remember the amount is a crucial factor).\r\n\r\nAlso, it is well known that RA and IBD patients share many of the same treatments as seen by RA treatments with DMARDs (Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs) simply being re-classified as DMAIDs (Disease-Modifying Anti-Inflammatory Bowel Disease Drugs) when used in IBD treatment. Since S1P treats RA in amounts that do not suppress the immune system, this provides a clear indication that S1P can treat IBD in amounts that do not suppress the immune system, as well. \r\n \r\nIn our long-term vision, we hope to bring this inexpensive to produce compound to market to treat IBD (and hopefully other autoimmune diseases), as quickly as possible, since inexpensive production costs means costs to the end-user would be considerably less than other treatments. Hence my GitHub Motto, “People Before Profit”. And also, since S1P treats autoimmune diseases without immune suppression, the longevity of those with an autoimmune disease, and their quality of life, would be substantially improved. \r\n \r\nOur patented compound will directly compete with several best-selling drugs, including the the second most best-selling drug in the world. We expect our compound will also undermine many pipeline drugs being developed by large pharmaceutical companies for autoimmune diseases. We anticipate fierce pushback from the pharma industry and vested interests. This is why we hope to collect enough funds from individual donors, such as yourselves, to finance our project aims in improving the longevity, and quality of life, of people suffering from autoimmune diseases.\r\n \r\nThank you for your contribution and remember to follow us!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reference_url":"https://kherion-technology.com/","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/8d6f74af84c1a7391289ee94d8e4b39e/KherionTechnologyMasterLogoCMYK.jpeg","admin_address":"0x92B01f389b314F8EB7fB508D0373E86DE0094cB3","amount_received":"2.9697","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any Token","contract_address":"0x0","metadata":{"gem":-118299999,"related":[],"upcoming":-100060500,"wall_of_love":[],"last_calc_time_related":1645366554.7345884,"last_calc_time_contributor_counts":1645385862.0059364,"last_calc_time_sybil_and_contrib_amounts":1645385863.2564344},"network":"mainnet","required_gas_price":"0","admin_profile":{"id":329143,"url":"/kherionsight","name":"KherionSight","handle":"kherionsight","keywords":[],"position":104,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/1dfaa17513efbe37eb43288431be4c84/kherionsight.png","github_url":"https://github.com/kherionsight","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}},"team_members":[{"id":329143,"url":"/kherionsight","name":"KherionSight","handle":"kherionsight","keywords":[],"position":104,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/1dfaa17513efbe37eb43288431be4c84/kherionsight.png","github_url":"https://github.com/kherionsight","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}}],"clr_prediction_curve":[[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0]],"clr_round_num":"","is_clr_active":false,"amount_received_in_round":"2.9697","positive_round_contributor_count":1,"clr_matches":[],"logo_url":["https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/8d6f74af84c1a7391289ee94d8e4b39e/KherionTechnologyMasterLogoCMYK.jpeg"],"details_url":"/grants/4431/autoimmune-disease-treatment-without-immune-suppr"},{"id":4416,"active":true,"title":"Track Top NFTS","slug":"track-top-nfts","description":"This is a tool used to track the price of items on opensea.

Many web3 experiences are pay-to-play, requiring crypto assets. Many assume crypto knowledge, which can intimidate nontechnical web2 users. \n\n\n>>>> A potential solution\n\nKarma is a web3 collaborative self-education platform that feels a little like web2 media. It's meant to give you \"learning superpowers\".\n\nContent can be anonymously published on Karma using a friendly editor. This content can then be organized within learning channels. Anyone can create content and channels anonymously or pseudonymously on Karma. Learning channels can be public, private, professional, academic, or even personal. Learning channels on Karma are like subreddits on Reddit - anyone can create, anyone can participate.\n\nWhen you join a learning channel, Karma will periodically prompt you to engage with channel content using spaced repetition. In this sense, Karma is a \"second brain\" that helps users install knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntro to the product: https://www.karma.fm/p/dscsccG/how-karma-gives-you-learning-superpowers\n\n\n>>>> Learn to earn\n\nI'm exploring three learn-to-earn mechanisms, with the caveat that I don't want to attract mercenaries (target demographic is \"lifelong learners\" and \"optimistic missionaries\" more than it is \"crypto native users\"):\n\n1) Mining rewards: As you mine knowledge on Karma, you earn money.\n\n2) Trickle-down tokenomics: members can fund ideas, and that money will \"trickle down\" into related contributions and conversations.\n\n3) Shared ownership. Karma will eventually decentralize ownership with autonomous tokens that cannot be bought, sold, or exchanged. These tokens travel from one wallet to the next, dripping Ethereum into profiles that 1) express a need for money and 2) have demonstrated proof of personhood. When you create a Karma profile, you're also creating a custodial wallet that facilitates this \"autonomous NFT\" behavior on L2 solutions like stardust.gg. \n\n\n>>>> Philosophy and strategy\n\nKarma's engineering philosophy prioritizes user experience and works backwards to technology implementations. Karma is currently in closed-source public beta. Its short-term strategy is to:\n\n1) Achieve PMF with regular users who don't care/think about technology details.\n\n2) Publish nontechnical content that resonates with nontechnical users. Draw traffic via SEO and word-of-mouth, and then allow normal users to \"stumble upon\" educational web3 media from web2 media.\n\nIf/when PMF is achieved, more effort will be invested in unobtrusive tokenomic design, tipping mechanisms, content development, recruiting, open-sourcing, and progressive decentralization: https://www.karma.fm/p/ZtGZYCN/progressive-decentralization-a-playbook-for-building-crypto \n\n\n>>>> Mission, team, and legitimacy\n\nKarma's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable economics through the power of collaborative self-education.\n\nThis is a solo project at the moment, but I'm eager to collaborate with values-aligned folks. @micksprojects on Twitter if you'd like to vibe-check or reach out.\n\nI'm building this \"sort of pseudonymously\" to minimize web2 career risk, but I'd be happy to verify my employment / legitimacy with anyone curious. \n\n\n>>>> Pipe dream\n\nThe pipe dream is for Karma to supplement institutional certifications with peer-to-peer certifications / \"proof of brains\". I'm envisioning a way to zk-prove that you hold a bronze/silver/gold badge in the domain of Web3 + C# coding (for example) so you can select bounties and vote on things that require verifiable subject-matter familiarity.

Exchange","slug":"zigzag-exchange","description":"DONATIONS FOR THE ZIGZAG GRANT ARE FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES ONLY\nDO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING IN RETURN\nTHIS IS NOT A SALE\n \nVision\n\nZigZag wants to be a revolutionary project in the ZK Rollup space and aims at the end-game scaling solutions for Ethereum. We want to be the first, we want to be the best. We want to push out great products with high quality as fast as possible. We do not limit ourselves. Our vision is not to launch a mediocre DEX. Instead, we are aiming to bring the usability of centralised exchanges to a DEX that previously was not possible. With ZK Rollups, it is. Having sufficient liquidity and orderbook depth is a key factor that holds back a lot of DEXs from succeeding, which is what our main aim is to get right.\n \nIntroduction \n\nZigZag is a decentralised orderbook exchange that utilizes ZK-Rollup tech by allowing traders to perform spot trades with minimal slippage and thick orderbooks. The problem that every AMM-based DEX has on other Layer 2 Rollups is having miniscule liquidity. For simple swaps the impact on price movement is not significant. However, if one is attempting to trade with size relative to over $500k, to get the best quotes it is necessary to bridge back to mainnet Ethereum and pay its fees for aggregated liquidity that is available there. ZK Rollups can solve this by offering negligible fees on transactions, allowing for any market inefficiency to be taken advantage of in an instant by market makers, which was previously not possible on a DEX. We are aiming to acquire sufficient liquidity to the extent that users will not have to pay Ethereum gas fees on mainnet in order to get quoted for a similar price.\n \nWe launched as the first and still the only DEX on zkSync 1.x. We will also launch as the first DEX on StarkNet, which you can currently try out on our testnet (limited functionality). Due to our first mover advantage we are capturing a lot of attention. Our volume has been breaking records every week. Last week we had a total volume of $52M with a record breaking day of $13.2M in volume on the last day of the week. \n \nTeam background\n\nOur team derives from crypto natives who are all experienced traders. Having personal experience in using decentralized exchanges allows us to recognize what is required for a DEX to succeed. The founder of ZigZag is a leading developer in Solidity, but we dare to say he is one of the, if not the best, Cairo dev out there. Our founder coded most of our DEX on zkSync and is the reason we exist and captured the first mover advantage we have. Another experienced dev joined our team recently and focuses on StarkNet and coding a non-custodial liquidity pool for market makers. With these guys we have a confirmed advantage and head start over any other competition building on StarkNet. Our team is joined by a small group of experienced devs who are very committed to helping us expand ZigZag even more. We are also in contact with most of the big and small players that are building next to us and are looking forward to collaborating with anyone for the good of Ethereum’s scalability.\n \nWith our combined skills, trading knowledge and maybe most importantly full-time commitment, we have the ability to create a leading DEX on zkSync and StarkNet from the development side, as well as ensuring that the incentives for traders are sufficient for them to not require an alternative.\n \nAchievements and future plans\n\nCurrently, we have our exchange live on zkSync 1.0. We’re using the native zkSync atomic swap feature to match orders. The gas fee is paid to the relayer and included in the atomic swap. We also made a bridge UI that taps into zkSync’s smart contract to bridge between Ethereum and zkSync. We have a StarkNet testnet up, but right now with limited functionality. However, this will soon change as Starkware is moving quickly. Be sure to check out our announcements. Furthermore, our governance proposal for Frax passed (https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-36-frax-x-zigzag-partnership/272): Frax will provide us for a total of $20M in liquidity. The first millions have arrived. This liquidity will be used to keep our DEX liquid on zkSync for now and once StarkNet fully launches we will move the majority of our liquidity there since it will have more functionality. We also have a MIM proposal up (https://forum.abracadabra.money/t/proposal-bring-mim-onto-starknet-through-zigzag-exchange/1065) to kickstart our DEX on StarkNet, since StarkNet will have more functionality than zkSync 1.0 currently has.\n \nLimit orders and margin trading will be possible on StarkNet and zkSync 2.0. On StarkNet we are also building a non-custodial liquidity pool that market makers can tap into to use and market make on our DEX. We can turn this into a dAMM. As said before, we made a bridge UI for zkSync, but we are working on a fast withdrawal mechanism. We’re also working on a bridge UI for StarkNet and will provide fast withdrawals there too. Another future plan is adding more bridges to our website. One that has the most priority would be zkSync <-> StarkNet. We are thinking further into the future about implementing NFT related features on zkSync: viewing and sending NFTs on our website. We would later turn this into the first NFT Marketplace. \n \nWe’re eagerly awaiting zkSync 2.0, which will be zkEVM. This will give us way more possibilities on our DEX. We might even build on other Layer 2 ZK Rollups if we have the developer capacity for it. Once Loopring, ZKSwap and Polygon Hermez are zkEVM, we could start building there.\n \nReasoning for grant\n\nAs the first DEX on zkSync we've been very active in the zkSync ecosystem, but also with the community and catering to them. One of the few live use cases on zkSync right now, besides our DEX, is donating to Gitcoin grants. This can be done in a cheap way by either by bridging funds from Ethereum Layer 1 -> zkSync Layer 2 (https://trade.zigzag.exchange/bridge) or by using a fiat ramp like Ramp Network (https://ramp.network/) to zkSync. These Gitcoin grants created demand for DAI, so a while back we added DAI pairs to our exchange (ETH/DAI, WBTC/DAI, DAI/USDC, DAI/USDT). A lot of people started using ZigZag to grab DAI for Gitcoin grants and started requesting us to create our own grant. They wanted to donate to us! We decided to open a Twitter poll (https://twitter.com/ZigZagExchange/status/1469983150180909057) and after 1 day more than 1300 people voted \"Yes\", telling us that they would want to donate to us. This gave us great confidence in creating our own grant. \n \nUse of funds\n\nAs seen in our tweet, we are self funding right now. This Gitcoin grant will give us the ability to spend more funding on development. We would love to scale up our development team and with the support of our community it seems like we will be able to do this. Development can mean anything ranging from frontend and backend development to GFX/UI/UX design.\n \nDeveloper? Contact us!\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback on our product, so please use our exchange, read our code in Github and join our community. If you are interested in our project and think that you could help us out or even contribute to building on ZK Rollups, don't hesitate and contact us here: https://info.zigzag.exchange/#contact. With our grant donations we will be able to take onboard more developers and maybe that person will be you! Who knows we’ll even see you on our team in the future!\n \nLinks\n\nWebsite: http://zigzag.exchange/ \nExchange: https://trade.zigzag.exchange/ \nGithub: https://github.com/ZigZagExchange/ \nTwitter:

Fund","slug":"science-fund","description":"Reimagining the path to discovery\nOur goal is to empower scientists freely, openly, and rapidly pursue their best scientific ideas. To achieve this, we are reimagining how discovery is funded. No grant applications. Transparent, traceable funding records. Rapid funding cycles that support more ideas early, and continue funding what’s working. Most importantly, we are growing the foundation of support for science by creating an unparalleled donor experience that lets you participate in the exciting process of scientific discovery. To this end Science Fund is developing a DApp to turn donating to science into a \"minting and collecting Science NFTs\" experience. Donors receive an immutable, time-stamped proof of their donation. Over time they can track the evolving impact through blockchain backed audit trails.\n\n\n\nHow it works\nDonors contribute to funding pools opened for a specific topic with an amount of their choosing.\nIn return donors receive a NFT receipt (a \"Science Funding Token\", SFT)\n\n\n\n\nCurated Funding Pool\nEach donation is added to a chosen funding pool. Researchers can apply through our open protocol with their track record from early published groundwork. As new results emerge from funded work, we update the NFTs metadata.\n\nImpact Tracing\nWe revolutionize the role and experience of donors: Their NFTs are a personal key to unlock an continuously evolving experience data trail about their donation’s impact.\n\nFuture Participation\nThe NFT receipts become the key to future interactions with the scientists they supported and endless new forms of participatory governance to the field they contributed to can evolve.\n\nHow do we allocate funding to scientists?\n\nWhen researchers apply to one of the topic specific funding pools they are not giving away their best ideas. They simply need to share their most influential scientific work (any already published scientific artifact they created such as a publication, preprint or even just a cool dataset) to a given pool. Selected scientists's works then form the basis of a growing evidence trail that is matched to the donor's minted NFT. The NFT receipts become the key to future interactions among scientists and donors and open a universe of endless new possibilities of mutual exchange and future interactions.\n\nShow me this actually works!\nWe are already working on a dApp that you will soon be able to experience at sciencefund.io to mint Science Fund NFTs and trace the impact they made over time. \n\nIn the meantime we have created a MVP of the donation NFT minter and NFT tracer here that works on Rinkeby. Try it!\n\nhttps://science-fund.herokuapp.com/\n\n\n\nYou find the code here\n\n\nOur first funding drive kicked off on December 1st 2021.\nFor the first funding drive we have decided to launch it as a traditional token sale on OpenSea on the Polygon chain. NFTs were created that each carry a fragment of the COVID-19 reference genome as a payload. You can check it out here: https://opensea.io/collection/science-fund-pandemic-data\n\nFunds raised through this sale will be donated to scientists working on pandemic preparedness. \n\n\n\n\nWho we are\nThe Science Fund team is composed of researchers, developers, designers, and rebels that have a shared interest in focused, pragmatic, mission driven solutions that can be rapidly tested and iterated in the field of funding scientific research. We have decades of experience in scientific research in the USA, Europe, Asia, and Australia as well as with large philanthropic organizations The Science Fund team is composed of researchers, developers, designers, and rebels that have a shared interest in focused, pragmatic, mission driven solutions that can be rapidly tested and iterated in the field of funding scientific research.

is to schooling what DeFi is to finance. DeSchool builds the infrastructure and the community to enable decentralized schooling. It solves systemic issues in current educational systems and aligns incentives for learners, educators, and employers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tao of DeSchool: reward retention and intention, and not just attention. Learning/teaching/working credentials should be about proof of curiosity and play.\r\n\r\n\r\nChallenge\r\nLearners, teachers, employers have limited time and resources. They get tired of playing two different games - the traditional school/university/certificates/jobs game AND the emerging games that the internet has enabled. The vision of DeSchool is to play one unified, holistic, positive-sum game where everybody wins.\r\n\r\nParts of DeSchool are inspired by Ivan Illich's work on Deschooling society.\r\n\r\n\"A DeSchooled society would be a society in which everyone shall have the widest and freest possible choice to learn whatever he wants to learn, whether in school or in some altogether different way.\" - John Holt\r\n\r\n\r\nWe're interested in building the base-layer educational infrastructure upon which a few affordances are built in:\r\nTeachers are incentivized to share their expertise and teach well.\r\nStudents don't enter immeasurable debt for the privilege to learn.\r\nLearning actions & outcomes are recorded on chain, creating a network of learning paths.\r\nShadow work by friends/peers/caretakers/parents in educating each other is accounted for.\r\nEmployers/DAOs are able to match these skills with available projects and people.\r\n\r\nWe believe in a few key things:\r\nEducation should be a public good.\r\nTeachers should get paid because they are highly undervalued.\r\nStudents should get verifiable credentials they can resharpen and use for life.\r\nWork is a natural extension of learning and happens throughout life. \"Learning on the job\" should be treated the same as learning in a university (and credentialized similarly).\r\nEducational costs shouldn't be a major bottleneck for parents/caretakers/guardians in making life decisions.\r\nWeb3 and the state of internet tech makes alternative education/schooling feasible.\r\n\r\nThere are specific deliverables to start with which the grant would go towards:\r\nmnemonic media (transformative tools for thought)\r\nfostering conversations on emerging education (similar to Crypto Culture and Society)\r\nnon-transferable NFTs for necessary credentials\r\npartnering with DAOs for education + employment programs (like a public goods school with the GitcoinDAO)\r\ndesigning systems which incentivize learners, educators, and employers\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nFree Learn\r\nRetention, not Attention\r\nBianca's Arena\r\nmore references are in the site\r\n\r\nIt'll take an interdependent web3 village to raise a child.

The tool is designed to value trust, commitment, and context and is meant to work together with other tools such as bounties, grants and P2P mechanisms that reward value delivered and task completion.\r\n\r\nThe core concept is to enable token streams that start/stop based on other data inputs (such as achieving a certain threshold of contribution as valued by other tools such as bounties in a specific time period). This way ad-hoc contributors and bounty hunters can \"graduate\" into core contributors and receive a basic stipend to reward their ongoing commitment and value they provide as carriers of organisational knowledge. This way, Minimum Viable Salaries bridge the gap between core teams and community contributors.\r\n\r\nYou can read more about the rationale for Minimum Viable Salaries in this mirror article.

for Charity||Users  500,000 - income:$0  (Years:9| Work:daily|Volunteers:70|Recommended by Firefox since 2022 (only 109 projects ever)","slug":"code-for-charityusers-500000-income0-years9-workd","description":"Dear Friends & Vitalik,\r\nwe are  github.com/code-for-charity\r\nwe continously spend our free time since 2012 to serve 0.5 million users. And are permanently recommended by Firefox. \r\n  Users' productivity & satisfaction are the currency of our hearts. \r\n Every $ *** can create a new feature, never made or published before, that 10,000 smart people were waiting for already and millions would appreciate *if* they ever see it..\t\r\nThis is our first priority. We reduce other jobs as much as financially possible.\r\n\r\nour most successful project yet is the original Youtube Add-On 'ImprovedTube' with 85+ unique features, to save time, ensure personal focus & convenience. Smart content filtering & history managing to come (https://github.com/code4charity/YouTube-Extension/issues/565#issuecomment-695357918 )\r\nGrowing several % per month (despite Youtube is not growing anymore)\t\r\ndespite extension ecosystems are neglected (completely unlike app stores, no standarized payments. nothing).\t\r\nAdblockers for Chrome are scheduled to lose functionality January 1 2023   ('manifest v3', not affecting us, but we will research remedies.)\r\n( For the average app, Google Play  processes several $1000 per year and Apple Appstore even 3 times more per app. Yet a typical relevant Browser extension just receives a few donations. Probably less than the average Linux package)\r\nRecently almost 100,000 users surprise-joined us from the the 'crypto nation' South Korea(, which also has the highest percentage of crypto users)\r\n\r\nwe love to help and work on several more projects, but especially always planned a charitable crypto. We would love to make use of our talents and passion there and eventually present that to the world. And to our existing users convincingly(, many who are 'techie/'nerds and who's trust us since so long). \r\n Thus we should delegate work-load.  \r\nWe make the code inviting to edit. There are developers, who will help and often are poor or modest even. (However we have no funding)\r\nWe can't work on half of the popular & meaningful wishes and that is sad. (And the work might never end as long as Youtube is updated😅)\r\n\r\nFunding will go a long, efficient way and also pay for our first campaign/s.  (We didn't even publish a full documentation.)\r\nYou can make our work feel fully appreciated for the first time.   Most of our missions will be eligible for gov. funding.   We want to eventually become a global, social, full time employer. \r\nMarket saturation for 'ImprovedTube' is far. While our success is earned / lasting, somebody reached 0.x million users recently, making something like a lite version with SEO, top features enabled by default,  and copying some of our code. A good app is worth a 5 minutes learning curve. So advertising Open Source, will help careless users to make better decisions. We want to apply for free charity ads from google too later. \r\nIf crypto keeps attracting more users, then eventually enough users will have a browser wallet... (such as Metamask or Brave, then, for example only $0.04/week micro-payments could be requested easily, (or as much as a user wants, ) then our extensions could finally self-sustain financially and kickstart so much more.\r\n\r\nThank you & many smiles!\r\n\r\nQuestions?\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  Awesome! the grant only went live for some hours and we received 10 donations.\r\nDid any of you notice ImprovedTube before or try it by now?\r\n(We applied early but unfortunately only were reviewed & accepted on the last day, of the funding round GR12, else we would have invited people, now waiting

Matrix","slug":"boston-matrix","description":"Rejuvenating Extracellular Matrix to Fight Aging\r\n\r\nOur mission is to develop a therapy that prevents age-related degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). We are focused on small molecules that have the potential to slow down aging, and protect people from diabetes, cardiovascular and Alzheimer’s diseases, by inhibiting cross-linking in the extracellular matrix. Boston Matrix is ​​a nonprofit. Our research and development process is transparent, and results are reported openly.\r\n\r\nWe are building a bioinformatic platform for screening molecules — \"expanding\" intermediate and endproducts of glycation (AGE), with subsequent validation in cell cultures and model animals.\r\n\r\nIn parallel, we are working on the screening and development of RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation endproducts) blocking molecules, through which AGEs induce inflammation and tissue degeneration.\r\n\r\nThe results of the project will form the basis for the development of a drug with a double protective effect: protecting blood circulation and metabolism in the nervous system.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Research and Experiment\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on rationalized design, synthesis and bioscreening of polysubstituted imidazoles and their bioisosters as antiglycating agents and RAGE inhibitors for reduction of the extracellular matrix rigidity, and associated pathological effects. The project is aimed at creating new substances (or finding suitable ones among already existing compounds) for slowing down aging processes associated with pathological glycation. \r\n\r\nThere are 3 main directions now: synthesis and screening of new compounds as well as in silico screening among known therapeutic agents (and, in case of success, further in vitro and in vivo bio testing), based on our hypothesis on DF-5 possible mechanism of action, which will be studied on different models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project is based on the research of compound DF5, which appeared to be the leading molecule for further drug design, as well as a hypothesis on the mechanism of DF5 action and protocols for preliminary testings, which were already developed by our scientific team. The agreement on collaboration with representatives of original DF5 developers was achieved, and some leading structures were designed, and ideas for simple and more sophisticated screening models were developed (see Fig. 2 and 3).\r\n\r\n\r\n(Figure 2: The general concept)\r\n\r\n\r\n(Figure 3: An example of a simple planned chemical screening)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat We Need Funding for\r\n\r\nFor the purchase of various chemical agents, deuterated solvents, laboratory animals, and laboratory equipment; it also covers compensation for the scientists involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECM and Aging\r\n\r\nThe extracellular matrix (ECM) fills the spaces between cells and serves as an internal network that connects the entire body. It makes up more than 30% of the body weight of an adult. Most of the ECM proteins (collagens and elastins) are formed during childhood and are poorly restored.\r\n\r\nAs we age, these proteins form chemical bonds with each other, called cross-links. This reduces the elasticity of the matrix, promoting inflammation and tissue degeneration.\r\n\r\nNon-enzymatic glycation is a pathogenic mechanism accompanied by the generation of AGEs compounds in ECM. The latter are involved in the disruption of microenvironmental, regulatory and structural functions of stroma, changes in cellular metabolism, biochemical/bioelectrical parameters of cells, development of diseases with a high degree of association with age-related pathologies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDifferent Types of Crosslinks\r\n\r\nHere you can see two examples of crosslinks we’ve analysed. You can take a further look at other five on our website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Team\r\n\r\nThe lead researchers of the project have access to the facilities and equipment of various universities and have sufficient experience highlighted in their CVs.

Ping: Decentralized Real-Time Collaboration Network Protocol for Web3","slug":"frontpage-ping-decentralized-real-time-collaborat","description":"The goal of the Frontpage Ping project is to build a real-time collaboration network protocol that is fully decentralized, facilitates the use of native community-specific tokens, and aims to become the real-time collaboration layer in the web3 stack. By integrating Frontpage Ping, any web2/web3 app/dApp enables social communication and collaboration with their communities based on token access and other specific rules designed by their community. \n\nFeatures\nNew, open, decentralized real-time collaboration network providing group voice, video, messaging.\nRules and roles defined by its participants.\nRuns in the browser, extendable through plugins and SDK.\nBlockchain-agnostic protocol, any signing-based mechanism that authenticates with tokens can integrate FPP into their dApp/chain.\nIncentivizes users to use the native token for their own communities to enable social features or use its own custom PONG token.\nIdentity and membership managed by Ethereum blockchain (for the alpha version)\nBuilt with peer-to-peer technologies that check for accountability of nodes while being privacy-preserving. \n\nVision - An ownerless collaboration platform designed to reincentivize pro-social behavior and cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\n\nFrontpage Ping consists of a global peer-to-peer network allowing regular web browsers to efficiently exchange messages with each other without a central server. Nodes can use the global network to find each other and form private networks connected directly with each other.\n\n\nRoadmap\n\nSeason One - Q1'22\nBuild out testnet for developers and platforms to integrate\nOnboard alpha communities (already finalized two dApps)\n\nSeason Two- Q2'22\nAdmin & Moderation tools\nFrontpage Ping Token launch (PONG)\n\nSeason Three- Q3'22\nLaunch mainnet\nGeneral

Spring 2022 Event Series","slug":"refi-spring-2022-event-series","description":"What is ReFi Spring? 🤔\nWe are curating a collection of in-person events in differing locations next year that cover various formats and perspectives. We are raising awareness about the regenerative finance movement to a range of actors:\n\nClimate activists\nLand stewards\nRegulators and local governments\nEntrepreneurs\nInvestors\nDevelopers & Designers\n\nWhy are we submitting a grant application? ☀️\nWe want to raise funds in order to support local event organizers to host meaningful conversations about the ReFi movement and tailor content to their specific context.\n\nOur objectives 🎯\nThese events aim to address a handful of core problems facing the industry:\n\nMost people mistakenly believe crypto is bad for the planet and therefore don’t engage\nRegulators don’t understand the power of crypto to address the most pressing challenges of our time\nCreating meaningful connections is much easier in-person than online\nClimate sensitive folks do not like to travel by plane too much\n\nThe team 🙌\nWe’re a growing group of organizers moving forward ReFi Spring 2022:\n\nFelix Fritsch & Giulio Quarta from Crypto Commons Association\nJakub Lanc from FreeCircle\nLuuk Weber from Kolektivo\nEugenio Battaglia \nSam Delesque from Closer.earth + re-encrypt.co + Traditional Dream Factory + re-build.co\nJohn Ellison from Toucan Protocol and KlimaDAO\nHereward McGillivray from climate2025\nDamiano Avellino from Platform Design Toolkit\nRobert Heilberg from dClimate and Arbol\n\nOur work 📖\nWe are creating an open source ReFi conference framework that makes it easy for local event organizers to schedule and facilitate a meaningful in-person event in their community.\n\nAlongside the framework we’re also hosting weekly calls to coordinate and onboard various events to ReFi Spring.\n\nThe idea is that by creating an open source framework and coordinating body we can enable a decentralized network of local events to create unique experiences tailored to their local context.\n\nRather than have one mega conference with significant embodied carbon from air travel, we want to encourage people to attend the event nearest them and avoid the most carbon intensive forms of transport.\n \nThe framework 🧮\nThe event framework provides resources that support conferences of varying sizes from:\n\nCasual meetup: 10 – 30 people\nSmall conference: 30 - 70 people\nMedium conference: 70 – 200 people\nLarge conference: 200 - 500 people\nMassive conference: 500+\n\nWhy small, local events matter 🎤\nGiven each local context as a different sample of local actors, we’ll reach a much more diverse audience by having a variety of local events as opposed to a single major conference in a major city.\n\nWe have confirmed events of varying sizes in the following locations:\n\nAmsterdam led by Luuk from Kolektivo (1 day, 150-300 participants)\nAustrian Alps led by Felix and Guilio from Crypto Commons Association (7 days, 60 participants)\nPrague led by Jakub from FreeCircle (1 day, 100 participants)\nLondon led by John from Toucan and KlimaDAO (2 days, 150 participants)\nVienna led by Felix from Crypto Commons Association in cooperation with Jakob Hackel from Economics University Vienna (2 days, 150 participants)\nNYC led by Robert of dClimate\nRe:encrypt in Abela, Alentejo led by Eugenio from Traditional Dream Factory (3 days, 40 participants mix IRL and online)\nBologna led by Damiano Dada from Platform Design Toolkit and Hereward McGillivray from climate2025 (1 day, part of a 1 month academy by Avanguardie Cooperative)\nMore events are coming soon! See http://refispring.com/ for updates\n\nWe're pursuing other funding sources 💸\nWe applied for grant funding from Regen Network on Nov 30 and are planning to apply for additional funding to the Ethereum Foundation as well as to KlimaDAO, IXO Foundation and other value-aligned projects. \n\nWe have not received any funding to date.\n\nOur budget\n\n$15,000 to enable the local events to make deposits and book venues \n$15,000 to market local events and promote ticket sales\n$10,000 in ticket subsidies for land stewards and indigenous people\n$5,000 to create the ReFi Event Framework\n$5,000 to create the ReFi Spring 2022 website\n\nWe'd be a grateful recipient of contributions from the Gitcoin community to steward the ReFi movement and hep accelerate web3 adoption

Open-Source & Decentralized system where users can use their NFTs to stamp on websites, games, articles, posts, videos, anywhere on internet. differentiating from the commonality. public can use this to add value, authenticity to their content while creating a decentralized-social-networking.\r\n\r\n\"One day digital stamps will become a commonality & the official standard to add value to any & all digital content. We’ve been working hard to pursue this dream & we will continue to do so with the same spirit this year too. Thanks for the support!\" \r\n\r\n~ team-cutouts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DREAM.\r\n\r\nThe goal of Cryptostamping is to introduce authenticity & transparency in the digital world, a new system through which people can stamp and add value to their content, certify, show support, talk or comment. \r\n\r\nThe internet grows endlessly, and it is in much need of a system which can organize all this jumbled content, filter the spam & bot-gen, push up what is user-valued. And our goal is to make sure this power rest with the users, in a transparent & decentralized way. \r\n\r\nThanks to the blockchain technology, all this is made possible now. Join us in building a better web experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTHE HOW.\r\n\r\nThe project relies heavily on smart contracts and NFTs to achieve this goal. People can buy an NFT and use it to stamp on any particular webpage, either adding value, or showing support, or commenting upon the content. \r\n\r\nThere are also many other use-case scenarios for stamping, please check https://cryptostamping.org/intro to learn more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPUBLIC EMBED\r\n\r\nAn opensource embed iframe that lets visitors to add their NFT stamp, users can embed this anywhere from articles to videos, to collect public opinions or support or any other use-cases mentioned above. The embed creates a standard for all other layered utilities of NFTs in future, making sure the button is safe. There are also plans to make this hosted on IPFS completely decentralizing it.\r\n\r\nDEMO (in Beta Testing)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBROWSER PLUGIN\r\n\r\nWhen internet started, people made or created platforms that can get you to content (google), to share content (Facebook), to pay (PayPal), all in separated individual platforms, in webpages or apps, but with the on-set of blockchain technology, people are going back & starting a new trend where the functionality is in a place between the user & the commodity (metamask connects users to apps to pay stuff) \r\n\r\nAnd this is the motive Cryptostamping stands for, to only act as a middleware between the user & digital content. The plugin will let you stamp & comment on any webpage and similarly view all stamps on any webpage. The entire functionality exists on the browser side in user control.\r\n\r\nDEMO (in Beta Testing)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------  \r\n\r\nECS (Ethereum Cryptostamping Standard)\r\n\r\nWe will be introducing a new standard called ECS which extends from ERC721 and it will take care of the basic functionality of all stamping related functionality and regulations. As we grow, there will be iterative of ECS1, ECS2, ECS3.. that adapt to the latest needs of the stamping industry. \r\n\r\nAll NFTs that need to be recognized as stamps must be written in `is ECS1` instead of `is ERC721`. There will be a linking system available for already deployed NFTs and contract\r\n\r\nGit Repo for ECS\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWORKING & AUTHENTICITY\r\n\r\nWhen you stamp, metadata would have to be signed specifically through your wallet, it will collect the nft token address & id, your wallet address, and store it along with signature from metamask. When someone opens the site or post, it will verify whether the stored stamps truly do belong to their owners, maybe the stamp got transferred or burned or something. It does this through the transaction history of that stamp, and check if the wallet address in stamping matches the current owner. In this way, a stamp will be displayed only after it's verified.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nETH 2.0 & ON-CHAIN STAMPING.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we are building and working using off-chain signing standard, much similar to how snapshot.org works, but in Q3/Q4 2022, we will be moving everything to on-chain stamping, the gas costs will still be considerable (~0.06 USD), though with techs like zk and shard chains, we believe the transactions will be much cheaper in future.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nA NOTE FOR THE CONTRIBUTORS.\r\n\r\nAll contributors will be given nft badges to represent your contribution. Although it has no substantial value, owning a badge means you were part of the team, the spark, the movement that will restructure the digital world for years to come.\r\n\r\nOfficial

METACITY. TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THE OPEN METAVERSE!","slug":"punkx-metacity-take-ownership-of-the-open-metaver","description":"TLDR: PUNKX helps citizens organize themselves on the metaverse, create real-world value, and on a global scale. PunkX is an online avatar platform and avatar creation system. It allows users to create avatars and interact with avatars created by other users. PunkX are empowered with programmable financial tools to create communities, participate in communities created by other avatars, and become autonomous.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nWe start by introducing the PunkX protocol to illustrate the importance of its many nice features in practice. We will talk about how it can be used by different groups of people, in many different situations. We illustrate a large range of cases, across quite distinct domains, where we believe the protocol can be useful in the near future. We start with the PunkX project.\r\n\r\nTHE PUNKX CITY PROJECT\r\n\r\nPUNKX IS OUR MOST AMBITIOUS PROJECT YET, THE BEGINNING OF A VIRTUAL CITY FOR OUR COMMUNITY. PROGRAMMABLE HIGH-END AVATARS, BORN ON THE METAVERSE.\r\n\r\nPunkX city was founded by digital avatars. It is a decentralized community of humans and software bots allocating resources to build, fund, and run the first city on the open metaverse. PunkX accelerate our evolution towards immaterial co-existence and help improve human performance. PunkX connect every human with a punk digital avatar the advanced software bots that live on the metaverse. \r\n\r\nThis groundbreaking technology has revolutionized Homo sapiens's ability to travel across realities and expand into new domains and activities. \r\nPunkX advance our civilization through the construction of a virtual city, a cyber-physical system, that has the power to affect global issues and change the global outlook. \r\n\r\nTHE USER INTERFACE\r\n\r\nPUNKX IS AN ONLINE AVATAR PLATFORM AND AVATAR CREATION SYSTEM \r\n\r\n=> You can create your avatar and interact with avatars created by other users.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDecentralized online avatar platform and avatar creation system. Avatars once created are unstoppable and controllable only by their owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=> Your avatar gets a dropbox to receive airdrops \r\n=>Use your inventory to safely store digital assets and NFT membership cards\r\n=>Trade PunkX if you like \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou get a dropbox and an inventory that you control.\r\n\r\n=>$FRNS TOKEN is avaialble to all PunkX to claim\r\nEvery city needs a currency to build its economy. PunkX city is launching the $FRNS token with a practically unlimited supply of one quintillion to allow avatars to experiment and find innovative uses. The token is only available for free after a Punk generation and is anchored to the avatar. Eligible owners can claim the token amount or not. If not the assets will always be stored by their avatar\r\n\r\n=>PunkX Community money pool\r\nIncome from sales is stored in a multi-sig public Ethereum account for protocol development. \r\n\r\nUPCOMING DEVELOPMENT STAGE 2\r\nThere is ongoing work that supports the following features. \r\n\r\n=>Start a public goods project\r\n=>You can support a project\r\n=>Use dynamic membership cards to build your community\r\n=>Create community-managed money pools to financially support projects\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAvatars assembly in communities and create metacities, cyber-physical systems that enable the exchange of goods and services between the digital and the real world. \r\n\r\nTHE PUNKX ASSEMBLY: META CITIES\r\n\r\nMetacity is a social coordination service on which citizens connect with each other and work together on public goods projects to build worlds they desire. Metacity is the web3 social media of the future, a participatory platform where citizens build worlds.\r\n\r\nMetacities have the potential to lift tens of millions of people out of poverty.\r\n\r\nWHY SHOULD WE CARE ABOUT CITIES\r\n\r\nBuilding cities is the single most important act of production within society and as such is the entity through which nations most clearly express their global aspirations and generate economic opportunity. Because opportunities matter, world populations are increasingly moving from rural to urban centres that facilitate wealth creation via scale, network effects, productivity, and efficiency gains.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS A META CITY?\r\n\r\nA Metacity is a community of digital avatars granted ownership of programmable financial tools. Their purpose is simple but powerful. To develop the decentralized, nongovernmental institutions that can serve as the foundation for the development of public goods projects and the economic success of cities and communities.\r\n\r\nMeta Cities are simultaneously multi player coordination games, decentralised participatory institutions and large scale cooperative enterprises.\r\n\r\nMeta Cities are decentralized policy tools to help citizens develop institutions that can serve as the foundation for economic success. Meta Cities do not depend on any government support and can build partnerships through matching funds pools. \r\nMeta Cities is a protocol that allows communities to experiment with new policies designed to attract business, foster economic growth, create jobs, empower small businesses, and support historically disadvantaged groups. \r\nBy fostering a permissionless and participatory environment, Meta Cities enable better institutions and economic growth.\r\n\r\nMeta Cities are a sandbox for radical experiments in economic and governance\r\n\r\nMeta City is a socio-technical invention, an extendable Decentralized Financial Protocol that enables the deployment of matching funds mechanisms and purpose-specific applications with unique traits for each city or community.\r\n\r\nMETA CITIES  INCREASE THE ECONOMIC OUTPUT OF CITIES AND CREATE REAL-WORLD VALUE\r\n\r\nCoordination, the ability for large groups of actors to work together for their common interests, is one of the most powerful forces in the universe. \"It is the difference between the global temperature going up 3-5'C and the temperature going up by a much smaller amount if we work together to stop it. It is the difference between poverty and accelerating innovation. And it is the factor that makes companies, countries, and any social organization driving forces.\"\r\nThe Metacity allows people to communicate with each other, and work towards common goals in a way that is not possible in the real world. Using cyber-systems people connect their digital avatars to the real world and the internet.\r\nMeta Cities on the open metaverse provide an entirely new paradigm for expanding human coordination at a global scale over a programmable transactional protocol that enables people to connect, communicate, and exchange goods and services. \r\nThese unique features create new user-owned participatory markets, new asset classes, and novel mediums for communication. That's why Meta Cities are noteworthy socio-technical inventions.\r\n\r\nMeta Cities, a potential new income source for governments through taxes\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE THE NEW BUILDING MATERIALS FOR META CITIES? \r\n\r\nBlockchain technologies emerged as a new digital concrete that binds together a wide range of domains and disciplines. On top of these foundations, the crypto community has developed a modular construction system that we use to create new building materials.\r\n\r\n○ $FRNS City Crypto Token\r\n\r\nThe Token is in the design process. We are currently exploring ways to introduce incentives and Quadratic Funding mechanisms.\r\n\r\n○ Digital Assets and Membership Cards\r\n\r\n\r\nAccess to Digital Assets and communities are made available to avatars as digital trading cards. Ownership of cards with customized traits and unique namespaces provides a shared code that people can use to connect with each other, enabling communities with different personalities and purposes to form around clubs and causes.\r\nIt is easy to buy cards from projects and products and exchange them creating markets. It remains to the community to explore a world of infinite possibilities. \r\nProgrammability provides creators with a vector to design and build a highly engaged community around their avatars and communicate value with a membership card.. This feature is useful in many contexts.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Avatars use dynamic membership cards to connect, exchange value, coordinate towards common goals, self-organize around causes, create complex online-offline connections or connect with their favorite brand in many ways.\r\n\r\nROADMAP\r\n\r\nWe are a native metaverse project and with this mindset we feed all revenue from initial and subsequent sales back into the project.\r\nOur core strategy is centered around using your PunkX avatar and membership card across worlds and realities. \r\n\r\nWHY A GITCOIN GRANT?\r\n\r\nWe're currently building hard and we're planning to ship before EOY. \r\n\r\nWe are still fully bootstrapped and with our 2 full-time core contributors and 2 part-time ones, we've been able to scale our team on the back of our own capital.\r\nWe are using this Gitcoin grant to partially fund the development of the project. Gitcoin grants can help us support the longer-term development of our open-source project. Funding opensource work is a hard problem and we wish to try what Gitcoin can do towards alleviating that problem. \r\nProper funding would change that and allow us to get more developers and build better infrastructure to provide a better experience for our users.\r\n\r\nMetacity is open-source. Everything we build is available to study, copy, modify and use in your own apps too. That part of Metacity is a public good. The purpose of the Gitcoin grant is to fund exactly that part. The open-source public good part of Metacity.\r\n\r\nWe wish to sincerely thank all the people who will contribute to the Gitcoin grant CLR round! \r\nThanks to you we will manage to collect funds that will help us cover a good part of our developing expenses in the last months. \r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nWHY SHOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE?\r\n\r\nTo help us keep developing our open-source protocol. \r\nWe definitely need all the help we can get.\r\n\r\nIf you like what we are doing and want to help us achieve our mission you can donate as much you want via this Grant. Even 1 DAI counts if it's happening during the CLR round thanks to the fund matching mechanism.\r\n\r\nAll funds we get from this grant will go towards the development of features for Metacity.\r\n\r\nHelp us create software that will enable you to take ownership of your virtual presence, your financial data, the Metacity network!\r\n\r\nOTHER WAYS TO HELP US\r\n\r\nDid you contribute? Thank you so much!!!\r\nDid you not contribute yet? Still thank you for your interest and for reading so far!\r\n\r\nIn either case, there are many other ways to help us:\r\nJoin our incentivized launch and spread the word. Tell your friends about it. Invite them to join too!\r\nBecome a contributor to Metacity. We welcome newcomers who want to work on awesome open-source software. If you are able to code in Solidity, web3. js and React please check our Github and get in touch with us.\r\nGive us feedback by creating Github issues.\r\nFollow us on Twitter:

automated knowledge extraction for longevity research","slug":"marduk-automated-knowledge-extraction-for-longevi","description":"\n\nMarduk is a platform that allows to automatically create scientific databases from a list of research papers. In turn, this provides an opportunity to train machine learning models to gain insights into the field and generate new ideas.\n\nWhat are we doing?\n\nWe create a web app that will help you structure your data into a machine-readable format. The user can upload a large list of publications, and we will help him automatically create a table with custom columns of any nature.\n\nThe main features of our app will include:\n\nTable autocompletion\nA smart reader that highlights \nFiltration and visualization of the results\nPublic data sharing\nTeam access and collaborative work\n\n\nWhy does our project matter for longevity research?\n\nNew research is often built on the preceding one. Being on the edge of science and not wasting your time reading thousands of papers only for a few informative paragraphs is a key advantage.\n\nWe collaborate actively with Open Genes and Open Longevity. The first one has already created a database of human genes associated with ageing, and the latest one is collecting data on lifespan-extending drugs. Both of them are open-source, and essential for successful research.\n\nManual creation of such databases is tedious, and we want to help them and many other researchers and laboratories all over the world. Users will be able to share their analyses and reviews with everyone else, which will increase the research pace drastically.\n\nWe believe that openness is a way to grow big. Aggregating and providing access to data is essential for field development.\n\nHow does it all work?\n\n\nA prototype mock-up of our service.\n\nAfter uploading a list of PDFs and establishing a table structure, our neural network will parse papers with respect to table columns and will fill in possible values in the table cells.\nUsers will be able to share their table projects, and work on them as a team, or even start an open-source project on the platform! One particular use case is a public leaderboard, where different treatments of age-related diseases will compete in terms of efficacy.\nLater we intend to add semantic search and autoloading of the most recent research papers.\n\nWhat is ready now?\n\nWe are a very early stage start-up. Right now we are actively working on the front-end and NLP engine. \n\nThat is why we need your help. The funds raised by this grant will enable us to run our service, keep the servers, finish our front-end and train our models. As soon as our front-end will be ready, we will provide access to our app to collect user data and start training our models. The earlier it happens, the better the models will be.\n\nWho are you?\n\nA small team of enthusiasts:\n\nDaniil Cherniavskii - NLP Engineer\nAlexander Valyukov - NLP Engineer, Back-end\nVictoria

Chat and Guild System in Dark Forest","slug":"zk-chat-and-guild-system-in-dark-forest","description":"Dark Forest is a fully decentralized and persistent RTS (real-time strategy) game. It is the first on-chain game to incorporate incomplete information (known as \"fog of war\"), thanks to zero knowledge proofs. \r\nDark Forest recent community round 1 organized by GuildW-MarrowDAO demonstrated the interoperable nature of Dark Forest by modifying the original Solidity contracts to add dynamic gameplay.\r\n \r\n“No man is an island, entire of itself,” wrote the English poet John Donne in January 1624.\r\n \r\nIf you are familiar with history, you will know how important the alliance system is in the war between nations. Alliances exist to advance their members’ collective interests by combining their capabilities—which can be industrial and financial as well as military—to achieve military and political success.\r\n \r\nIn previous rounds, some alliances formed by DAO already existed. In fact, alliances can be either formal, written treaties or informal, unwritten agreements based on anything from tacit understandings to verbal assurances. These, may be good enough. However, due to the difficulty of identity verification (not everyone verifies their Twitter) and loose strategic planning, it is hard to implement joint operations in practice. \r\n \r\nBecause of this, we built up a chain layer alliance system for dark forest players. Start your journey at DarkAlliance to select guilds of choice, discover tasks, utilize gaming tools like group chat or bulletin board, and boost funny based on their performance and engagement in the games.\r\n \r\nWho are we?\r\nWe are a group of Web3 developers from Guild W and RhizomeDAO Labs. The members have backgrounds in Computer Science, Mathematics and Electronic Engineering, with many developers who have worked in the blockchain industry for many years.\r\n \r\nGuild W is the first on-chain e-sports team, incubated by MarrowDAO. The main members are Solidity developers, node operators, blockchain game players and investment analysts. All of them are loyal players of the Dark Forest. \r\n \r\nSo far, we have launched DarkSea, the most traded marketplace in the Dark Forest game; DF Explorer, a GPU exploring tool; and Dark Gang

Drugs","slug":"open-drugs","description":"\r\nOpen Drugs - the database of drug therapies in the field of life extension. \r\n\r\nThousands of papers report results of intervention testing programs [1,2] - changes in the longevity of a different species using various interventions in biological processes, including medication.\r\nAbout 1500 mostly mild but statistically significant lifespan increasing drug assays have been cataloged to date using over 560 drugs in 30 species[3] mostly in worm and fly. This suggests an opportunity to contrast and compare the effects and mechanisms of many pharmacological perturbations to drastically accelerate and focus the search for anti-aging interventions as it has already been done in the existing DrugAge[3] project. \r\nHowever, a closer look reveals that the data collected there is inconsistent and full of errors. Searching DrugAge for caffeine produces 31 records, where results for worms at a dose of 7.5 mM are reported to both decreased lifespan by 11.6% in one study and increase by 19.6% in another (both marked \"significant\"). There are 20 entries for rapamycin in mice, showing both 8% and 36.7% median lifespan increase in the same strain at the same 128 ppm dose. \r\n\r\nWhat conclusions can we draw from this? Which paper do we trust more? What additional conditions might have influenced the results of these experiments?\r\n\r\nIn order to get closer to the answers to these questions, we decided to revise the existing literature and create a new, expanded version of the database of aging-related compounds.\r\nOur approach is to take every detail of the experiment into account. What was the strain or breed of the organisms, at what temperature they were kept, what was the start point of the therapy, how exactly the active substance was delivered... Each study has dozens of nuances, and any of them could have an impact on the result. We are convinced that all of them need to be taken into account in order to provide a solid foundation for research in the lifespan-extending field.\r\n\r\nTo implement this approach, we are starting the development of our new aging-related drugs database - Open Drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1. Open Drugs prototype.\r\n\r\nThe list of the details of interventions may vary depending on species and the experiment design, but in common we decided to keep such aspects as:\r\n\r\nSample size of the control and the treatment groups: how many animals were used in the particular experiment\r\nAll available survival data on control and treatment groups\r\nActive substance delivery method: injection/food/drink/environment\r\nSubstance delivery regime: one-time/repeated/continuous/...\r\nThe actual dosage of substance\r\nDelivery vehicle: water, ethanol, DMSO...\r\nDiet conditions: what is the feed, are there any nuances in its preparation\r\nLight cycle: light intensity, light/darkness hours\r\nTemperature conditions\r\nStarting point of treatment in %% of lifespan: larvae/embryo, juvenile, mature\r\nDuration of treatment in %% lifespan \r\nDensity of animals: count per tank/cage/plate\r\n\r\nEach of these parameters may be important for understanding the differences in research results. An actual drug amount delivered per time would be much more descriptive than common \"concentration\" designation that often is hard to interpret because drug may be delivered with food once a day, or twice, or dissolved in water being continuously consumed, or just in the environment (like for fish or daphnia) - so actual dosage is very different since drugs are metabolized and excreted differently depending on a mode of administration. Temperature and light exposure could affect both the animals themselves and the drug: species lifespan may be temperature-dependent, active substances may be unstable in the room temperature or under intense light. Variance of density could cause changing of actually consumed feed and drugs, and social interaction might affect lifespan. \r\n\r\nAnother crucial part of the longevity-related studies database is the control groups. Focusing on the controls we can raise many interesting questions like: normal lifespan of mouse strain B6 on ad-libitum diet, across all the studies ever published; Is a certain paper reporting life extension reliant on sound controls and thus trustworthy; What are the robust strains of certain species which give similar lifespan distribution for controls across many studies; How do \"standard\" conditions (temperature or diet) compare to one another for a given strain/species. \r\n\r\nSuch kind of information may be very useful for designing the further research, and we are already proven that we’ll find there some interesting aspects: Fig. 2 presents lifespans of control mice from the ITP[1] project showing discordance in males but not females of U.Texas from U.Michigan and JacksonLabs. The difference of about 15% in the median couldn’t be explained right now, but we believe that a closer look at the life of controls under different conditions will help us understand this.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2. Discordance in the lifespans of the control male mice with the same strains in different labs from ITP project\r\n\r\nTo implement such a project, it is necessary to organize the collection and verification of data. We are developing a system for entering data from publications, which will allow curators to fill and moderate the information from the literature. The concept of the system is shown in Fig. 3, it is currently under development. \r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3. Prototype of the CMS for our database.\r\n\r\nThe final functionality that we strive for is to make this system open to the community and, especially, to the authors of publications themselves, which will allow the project to become self-sustaining and constantly updated by those who are interested in high-quality structured data.\r\nThe database will be searchable at any point, allowing convenient data dumps for further analysis. Another important point is that the project will be open source, we will publish the source code on the GitHub platform. \r\n\r\nWhat can we all get from this project?\r\nBy carefully structuring all research data, we will be able to:\r\n- identify the most and least important conditions in experiments and in the selection of model organisms, thus helping to improve research design\r\n- discover white spots in research, creating a groundwork for upcoming experiments\r\n- create the most high-quality dataset on substances, which can later be used for analysis, for example, select the most tested substances and use this list in ML-based research for similar compounds.\r\n\r\nThe project is being developed from the idea and under the supervision of Leonid Peshkin by a team from Open Longevity (a non-profit organization and a community of people, acting in favor of radical life extension). \r\n\r\nRefs:\r\n[1] ITP

Aztec Protocol. This will require custom abstractions, allowing us to decode the rollup byte string into useful transactional data. We will also build a set of charts tracking activity on Ethereum Mainnet related to the Private Rollup Bridge. \r\n\r\nHere's some examples of metrics we want to be able to monitor:\r\nVolume of deposits per asset on Aztec's L2\r\nVolume of transfers per asset on Aztec's L2\r\nNumber of active accounts on Aztec's L2\r\nTotal fees spent by users on Aztec's L2 as well as fees spent by Rollup processing on Mainnet\r\nVolume of transactions and fees spent interacting with Aztec's bridge on Mainnet\r\nPer bridgeId metrics for Aztec Connect > L1 interactions with popular DeFi protocols\r\n... and other metrics useful for the community!\r\n\r\nzkRollup technology is still very novel and would benefit from more transparency in regards to network growth and user activity.

Dynamics","slug":"life-dynamics","description":"Life Dynamics is an automated system for large-scale screening of the effect of molecules and other interventions on the lifespan and healthspan of nonmammalian laboratory animals. It will be able to create good quality big datasets on the budget and in no time, which is much needed if we want to see any shift in longevity science within our lifetime.\r\n\r\nNowadays, there is an acute problem of large-scale testing of interventions and substances for life extension in the longevity field. An appropriate study on laboratory animals should be conducted to understand whether the test substance or combination can prolong life. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure that the control and experimental groups live in the same conditions and are numerous. It is essential to regularly conduct tests of these groups to measure their biological condition and ensure that the living conditions do not undergo dramatic changes throughout the experiment. Also, longevity experiments are approximately equal in time to the organism's lifespan on which they are conducted. In addition, the ethics committee does not allow experiments on survival with many important types of laboratory animals, for example, mice. That is why only nonmammalian short-living animals are appropriate for survival assays. However, it is far harder to estimate the physical state of living organisms that are more than a hundred times smaller than mice. Researchers often synthesize many variants of molecules with similar structures. Choosing the most non-toxic and well-absorbed by the body requires large-scale verification of these structures exactly on living organisms and not on laboratory systems such as cell lines. At the moment, there is no available solution to the above problems. We propose to overcome such issues with the help of our automated Life Dynamics system.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have engineered a system for experiments with Daphnia. Daphnia organisms have many characteristics that ensure the quality of the data obtained and the short duration of experimental procedures (Figure 1). We plan to use our approaches to create automatic systems for fruit flies and fish in the future. \r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1. Advantages of Daphnia.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the automated installation and a brief description of its interaction with the user is shown in Figure 2. The system consists of many modules. One module corresponds to one experiment and consists of control and experimental groups. The user selects a drug or a group of drugs in the application and the protocol for its supply. Then, the drug is supplied to the experimental group and food to the control and experimental groups in automatic mode. Fixed cameras capture how Daphnia move in both groups, records are then sent to the server, and tracking and automated counting occur. In the application, the user sees the result of the action of the geroprotector, and this result also goes to our Open Life Dynamics Database.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2. Fully automated system with a large number of cassettes: pairs of control and experimental groups. Here one can see not only a diagram of the experimental setup but also an interaction system for users to order research remotely.\r\n\r\nAlso, we have developed a compact semi-automated system (Figure 3). In a semi-automated system, home water, drug, and food enter the aquarium with the help of pumps but should be prepared by the user every time. Tracking and counting of daphnia are also automatic.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3. There is no automated supply of the test substance in a simplified system. But it does have an automatic tracking and counting algorithm. \r\n\r\nWhat is already done:\r\n\r\nDevice construction:\r\nThe detailed plan of the modular system of aquariums with the selection of the most suitable materials\r\nThe method of non-toxic gluing of aquarium parts. Selection of the most suitable and non-toxic materials for pumps and other parts of the system\r\nThe optimal geometry of the Daphnia section, which allows for effective shooting of moving organisms, purification of water from offspring and corpses, and water aeration\r\nSolutions for most convenient for Daphnia water flows in system\r\nAll parts for the semi-automated system produced\r\nFirst prototype with automated drug supply and home water change, and counting of organisms number (Figure 4)\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4. First prototype with automated drug supply and home water change, and counting of organisms number.\r\n\r\nAlgorithms:\r\nA computer vision algorithm that counts the number of Daphnia in a recording with 10% intervals\r\nTracking algorithm that estimates velocities and tracks each organism individually\r\nA neural network trained to determine the bio age of Daphnia\r\n\r\nUser interface:\r\nNetwork architecture for wireless data transmission from the camera\r\nTelegram bot for the user for getting data about the result of the experiment\r\n\r\nBiology:\r\nProtocol for the nutrition of Daphnia and their maintenance under normal conditions\r\nMethod for getting groups of Daphnia of the same age\r\n\r\nOur advantages: \r\n\r\nIn our team, we have advanced programmers and physicists. We are currently creating a bio age model that reflects a health state of a group of studied organisms according to longitudinal measurements of their movements. This biomarker would allow us to conduct experiments in an even shorter period (approximately ten days).  \r\n\r\nOur principal engineer is Vladimir Kalyaev, the Head of FabLab and Machine Shop Shared Facility at Skoltech, who is advanced and very experienced in chemistry and manufacturing. \r\n\r\nApplications: \r\n\r\nAccording to [10.1002/ijc.20577], Daphnia has a sufficient intercellular substance with protective and other functions. This makes it possible to reproduce the glycation of the Daphnia matrix with the subsequent study of the formed glycation products. It is known that the drug alagebrium, contrary to numerous successful in vitro studies, did not show sufficient activity in vivo. Therefore, the ability to have an inexpensive model that reliably assesses the activity of the сrosslink breaker in the organism, which is our system, is crucial.\r\n\r\nWe are testing whether Daphnia Magna can be used as a model organism to study age-related changes in the matrix.\r\n\r\nThe first step was to check whether glycation of the Daphnia matrix was possible.\r\n\r\nWe managed to create environmental conditions with the content of glycating agents suitable for Daphnia living. The mixture of chemicals that cause advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) formation consisted of methylglyoxal (MGO) and glyoxal (GO) 1:1, total concentration 0.5 mM. The same chemicals can cause the formation of AGEs in humans. Glycation was carried out under conditions of food deprivation, for 24 hours, at a temperature of 25-30C. It is worth noting that the concentration and composition of the glycating mixture were selected so that it was not toxic and did not cause the death of Daphnia.\r\n\r\nAfter glycation, the animals were lysed in sodium hydroxide. The shells and carcass were not subjected to lysis and were removed by centrifugation.\r\n\r\nThe determination of AGEs in the lysate was carried out by the spectrofluorimetric method — registration of fluorescence, specific both for AGEs and for many cross-links of glycated proteins. We determined the presence of pentosidine, vesperlysines A and B, crossline, and argpyrimidine.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of glycating Daphnia matrix in the presence of carbonyl compounds allows testing new anti-glycating agents in this short living organism.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, we have shown that Daphnia can be successfully glycated in corresponding conditions. Below (Figure 5) are the spectra showing the dependence of the fluorescence intensity on the excitation wavelengths corresponding to different AGEs. The analysis of lysate of glycated and non-glycated Daphnia was performed in 3 repetitions (red lines correspond to the group of Daphnia exposed to the glycating mixture, green lines correspond to the control group). For all the studied AGEs, the differences between control and experiment were significant (pv<1e-04).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5. Spectra, corresponding to different AGEs\r\n\r\nOur next step is studying how the glycation of the Daphnia matrix affects their lifespan and whether it is possible to prevent it by anti-glycating agents. In addition, we will explore how the bio age of Daphnia with a glycated matrix changes before and after exposure to anti-glycating agents and cross-link breakers. We plan to do this in our semi-automated system.\r\n\r\nGrant funds will be spent on:\r\n\r\nPurchase of necessary materials - acrylic plates, adhesives, Arduino, Raspberries, cameras, hoses, pumps, etc.\r\nSalaries of laboratory assistants and workers who produce our devices\r\nChemical substances (drugs, ADAM, hormones for producing males, etc)\r\nLaboratory equipment \r\n\r\nOur

Genes fights aging collecting missing data","slug":"open-genes-fights-aging-collecting-missing-data","description":"Structured data on human genes associated with aging in one place and format\r\n\r\nOfficial website\r\n\r\nFresh updates:\r\nSubscribe our Medium and read regular posts about molecular biology of aging\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen Genes  is a biological database of human genes associated with aging and lifespan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMain page.\r\n\r\nOpen Genes is about open and structured data. We give researchers in aging genetics efficient tools for analyzing our data: gene functions, evolution, the influence of gene activity on lifespan, age-related changes in gene expression, associations of allelic variants of genes with longevity and age-related phenotype, processes the gene products are involved in.\r\nThis is a potential tool for finding white spots in the genetics of aging, which means new ideas for research.\r\n\r\nBut foremost, Open Genes adds new parameters for evaluating the quality of lifespan experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nData tables with researches conditions and results on a gene page.\r\n\r\nThe results of the experiments show that by changing the activity of just one gene, we can extend the life of nematodes and flies two or more times, and for mice — one and a half times. The GeneAge database contains more than two thousand genes.  Changes in the activity of that genes affect the lifespan of model organisms such as mice, nematodes, flies, and yeast. More than 1,800 mutation combinations and their effects on lifespan are provided in the SynergyAge database.\r\n\r\nToday, there are thousands of known biological databases. However, among them, there are very few biological databases approaching aging. Those few existing resources have some drawbacks, such as the lack of a unified rigid data structure, convenient tools for data analysis, and detailed experimental conditions that would allow evaluating the quality and reliability of the results.\r\n\r\nThere is a dramatic number of things the existing genetic databases are missing:\r\nStructured data about changes in genes that extend lifespan in mammals\r\nInformation on allelic variants of genes associated with longevity in humans\r\nComplete information on age-related population-average changes in gene expression in tissues in humans and animals\r\nData on the evolutionary history of the aging genes\r\nA set of genes associated with aging and their key characteristics put together\r\nAbility to group and compare genes according to various criteria and their combinations\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen developing OpenGenes, we relied on the approaches of these two databases. We also asked questions:\r\nWhat data is essential for assessing the quality of an experiment?\r\nConsidering the quality of the experiments and the significance of the results, what genes can be viewed as the most attractive targets for the therapy of human aging?\r\nWhy aren't experimental results always reproducible?\r\nWhat kind of improvements or deterioration in the health of model organisms were observed with changes in gene activity?\r\n\r\n\r\nAPI documentation.\r\n\r\nTo answer these questions, we provide accurate, complete and structured data on experimental design, model organism, and results. We provide approximately up to 40 parameters for each individual manipulation, depending on the method and data availability:\r\n\r\ncontrol line;\r\nsex;\r\nthe number of animals in the control and experimental groups;\r\ntemperature;\r\ndiet;\r\nthe main effect on gene activity (suppression, enhancement or switching of function);\r\nmethod of exposure (obtaining transgenic animals, exposure with a drug, inducible mutation);\r\nmethod (RNA interference, knockout, additional copies in the genome, protein therapy, and others);\r\ngenotype obtained as a result of genetic manipulation;\r\ntissue specificity;\r\ndrug;\r\nconditions for taking the drug (frequency, dosage, route of administration, age of onset and termination of the course);\r\npercentage of change in the expression of the target gene with an indication of the tissue where measurement was carried out;\r\nresult in relation to life expectancy (increase, decrease, increase in life expectancy in animals with a reduced life span);\r\nminimum, average, median and maximum control lifespan;\r\nminimum, average, median and maximum life expectancy of the experiment;\r\n% change in life expectancy;\r\nstatistical significance;\r\nresults in relation to age-related processes (processes in which improvements were observed and processes in which deterioration was observed as a result of manipulation).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA piece of the visualized database structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nCombining these parameters allows you to assess the quality of the experiment and better understand its results. The lifespan of one line of an organism may vary in different laboratories. The lower the lifespan of an animal, the greater the percentage it can be increased using genetic manipulation, and not always such an increase may mean overcoming the species limit. That is why the absolute values ​​of the lifespan of the control group and experimental animals are essential. And it’s not just about the percentage of change. But what determines the lifespan of an animal? To answer this question, we provide detailed data on the containment conditions.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of interventions such as RNA interference, therapy with a vector with extra copies of the gene or a drug for which the gene product is a specific target, depends on the age at which therapy is started. Some interventions can be effective even in old age. In other cases, therapy must be started even before the onset of age-related changes. In addition, the effect of changing the activity of genes in a certain tissue, and not in the whole organism, can differ significantly (Bluher M. et. Al., 2003; Princz A. et al., 2020). Thus, a detailed structured description of all conditions of the intervention allows for a more accurate interpretation of its results.\r\n\r\nForm for filling data from studies manually by biologists. The updated data will appear on the website in a few months.\r\n\r\nIn addition to detailed data on the increase and decrease in life expectancy, we provide additional results of the intervention: a list of processes in which improvements and deterioration were observed as a result of genetic manipulation. This approach allows one to see the possible mechanism of the effect of genetic manipulation on life expectancy and opens up great opportunities for the search for potentially successful combinations of targets. This will make Open Genes a powerful tool for finding them.\r\n\r\nBenefits\r\n\r\nAll provided data is up-to-date and proven. Open Genes regularly adds fresh data from aging research papers and the other databases. Our biologists manually check all data. All genes added to the database are being checked by selection criteria.\r\n\r\nThe data is structured and available for analysis by data scientists and bioinformaticians. Everything that is possible is given in a strict structured form. Try Open Genes API and use data in your own projects. \r\n\r\nWe collect genomic data and proteomic and transcriptomic data (age-related changes in protein levels, protein activity, mRNA, associations of protein and mRNA levels with longevity and age-related phenotype).\r\n\r\nWe constantly develop and improve functionality: search, sorting, filters, data download, data visualization, and much more.\r\n\r\n\r\nFiltered search feed.\r\n\r\nWe take the best from other aging genetics projects. We update and check their data, link it with our own, and bring it to a single form.\r\n\r\nOpen Genes is an open-source project. You can copy the code of all our applications and our data and continue development with your approach. You can also improve existing features or add data and suggest these changes. Funding Open Genes, you fund aging research tools.\r\n\r\nAlso, our product is scalable and uses a modern technology stack. This is something that biologists often do not think about when launching IT projects.\r\n\r\nHow can you use Open Genes?\r\nUse a dataset on human genes associated with aging in your research.\r\nDevelop machine learning models based on gene data.\r\nDevelop genetic and diagnostic panels based on the presented data.\r\nSearch for new targeted biochemical ways of life extension and prediction of the effectiveness of aging therapies.\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks\r\nAbout Open Genes\r\nFAQ\r\nAPI documentation\r\nGitHub\r\nRequest a feature\r\n\r\nTry newly added features\r\n\r\nOur API now works faster. Read API documentation to use all its features, such as gene filters and detailed experiment data.\r\n\r\nAll data from the research papers is presented in tables on the gene page. You can read additional data for each research by clicking \"Open details\".\r\n\r\nIn a search feed click on the \"Filters and Fields\" button under the search bar to see all existing fields and filters.\r\n\r\nOn the main page, select the Gene Ontology annotation search. This is a search for aging genes in GO annotation texts. For example, you are looking for “cellular response”. The search will be performed for all annotations where this phrase occurs.  For example: “cellular response to leukemia inhibitory factor” or  “cellular response to heat”. You will see all genes with these annotations and see all GO-terms.\r\n\r\nDownload the Open Genes database dump from https://open-genes.com/download. We also added detailed documentation for our API for developers.\r\nWe are currently working on uploading data to csv. In the meantime, you can download the search result on the main page or upload the genes added to Favorites.\r\n\r\nIn Favorites you can share the list of genes by generating a link. Click on the \"Share\" button and the link will be copied to the clipboard.\r\n\r\nWe have added data on the mechanisms of aging. Aging mechanisms are categories by which you can define the role of a gene in aging. These categories are not chosen by chance. Each aging mechanism is assigned based on a set of GO-terms — Gene Ontology categories associated with genes.\r\n\r\nWhat we are going to improve next\r\n\r\nAdd missing data on associations of longevity polymorphisms;\r\nRank genes according to the evidence of a gene's association with aging, taking into account the number, type and quality of studies;\r\nAdd data on the effect of geroprotectors, sports and diet on gene expression;\r\nAdd more filters and gene lists to identify potential targets for aging therapy by searching for intersections between genes according to different criteria;\r\nDevelop a tool to find potential targets and target combinations for aging therapy;\r\n\r\nWhy funding Open Genes\r\nFor scientists\r\nScientists of molecular biology and genetics get an instrument to compare their results with the structured results of other studies. It allows them to search prospective research topics and to plan experiments.\r\n\r\nFor investors\r\nInvestors take advantage of understanding the field of aging genetics. Comparing genes associated with aging with the gene targets of longevity startups, they can make a reasoned decision for finding the right one.\r\n\r\nFor biohackers\r\nBiohackers can appreciate data on the impact of interventions on age-related changes in gene expression. They also will be able to compare the result of proteome analysis with the set of genes in our database.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat the grant funding will be spent for\r\n\r\nKeeping data up to date (adding new data)\r\nCollect research data with combinations of interventions\r\nAnalyze data from the HAGR database on age-related changes in expression (up to 2014), edit and supplement them\r\nAnalyze data from the HAGR database on associations with longevity (up to 2017), edit and supplement them.\r\nCollect and organize data from new studies (after 2014) by age-related changes in expression and upload them to our database\r\nCollect and organize data from new studies on associations of polymorphisms with longevity (after 2017) and upload them to our database\r\nAdd missing data from the NCBI, UniProt, Reactom databases:% homology of the human gene and orthologs of model organisms, transcription variants, protein ligands, post-translational protein modifications, interactions between proteins.\r\n- HAGR\r\n- NCBI Entrez\r\n- NCBI Homologene\r\n- UniProt\r\n- Reactome\r\nAdd data from ABDB: direction and significance of age-related changes in expression according to the results of their meta-analysis\r\nAnalyze and structure data on age-related changes in the plasma proteome\r\nAdd data on age-related changes in the plasma proteome to the database\r\nDevelop an algorithm for ranking genes according to evidence of association with aging: take into account the number of studies, types of studies, rating of journals, the statistical significance of the results\r\nAnalyze the databases on cellular aging, interactions between genes and the plasma proteome and determine what data to be collected\r\nSearch for studies on the effect of geroprotectors on gene expression and structure this data\r\nCollect and structure data on lines of model organisms\r\n\r\n\r\nReference\r\n\r\nBluher, M.

will promote adoption of this world-changing tech.\r\n\r\nEven with limited resources devoted so far, zkrollups.xyz has emerged as the leading resource for discovering what tools exist within the wider zkRollup ecosystem. It’s been accessed by over 50,000 users, an average of >5,250 per week. We believe that the majority of users are investors looking for the next project to back. However, it is obvious that it’s also helping the crypto community find like-minded developers and discover new groundbreaking technologies.\r\n\r\nOur Plans:\r\n\r\n-- Improve layout and navigation: an overhaul of usability and design \r\n-- Add project details pages: cards link to detailed project pages \r\n-- Add token pages: existing and planned tokens (authoritative sources)\r\n-- Add comparison features: e.g. wallet comparisons\r\n-- Content and marketing:\r\n   -- Social media: Official Twitter, Reddit etc \r\n   -- Newsletter: fortnightly email/blog newsletter\r\n   -- Interviews: video and text interviews with zk projects","reference_url":"https://zkrollups.xyz/","logo":"https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/1cdb052821f6919fe92e25dcf6bae59e/Gitcoin_Grant_Logo.png","admin_address":"0x42780F29141e554F6C8AEFf0C7a6b60F33C00a8E","amount_received":"7.9928","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any Token","contract_address":"0x0","metadata":{"gem":-122487997,"related":[[12,4],[4352,2],[4597,1],[4573,1],[4287,1],[4165,1],[4027,1],[4466,1]],"upcoming":-100050500,"wall_of_love":[],"last_calc_time_related":1645366539.8831537,"last_calc_time_contributor_counts":1645385776.3693252,"last_calc_time_sybil_and_contrib_amounts":1645385776.408098},"network":"mainnet","required_gas_price":"0","admin_profile":{"id":98341,"url":"/jaazinn","name":"Jason Garland","handle":"jaazinn","keywords":["JavaScript"],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/1a5577c69ac5b8916e1b18ce921e117a/jaazinn.png","github_url":"https://github.com/jaazinn","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}},"team_members":[{"id":98341,"url":"/jaazinn","name":"Jason Garland","handle":"jaazinn","keywords":["JavaScript"],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/1a5577c69ac5b8916e1b18ce921e117a/jaazinn.png","github_url":"https://github.com/jaazinn","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}},{"id":107025,"url":"/milvinae","name":"Joel Kite","handle":"milvinae","keywords":["CSS","JavaScript","HTML"],"position":0,"avatar_url":"https://c.gitcoin.co/avatars/1da4543176a3689cbf2051d240e775c1/milvinae.png","github_url":"https://github.com/milvinae","total_earned":0,"organizations":{}}],"clr_prediction_curve":[[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0]],"clr_round_num":"","is_clr_active":false,"amount_received_in_round":"7.9928","positive_round_contributor_count":3,"clr_matches":[],"logo_url":["https://c.gitcoin.co/grants/1cdb052821f6919fe92e25dcf6bae59e/Gitcoin_Grant_Logo.png"],"details_url":"/grants/4268/zkrollupsxyz"},{"id":4263,"active":true,"title":"Using ZK for game optimization in Dark Forest","slug":"using-zk-for-game-optimization-in-dark-forest","description":"Dark Forest is an MMO strategy game built with zkSNARKs on Ethereum and xDAI. We had full fun playing Dark Forest, but at the same time, we have some ideas and plans to improve the game using zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nWe have many ongoing programs:\r\n\r\nMirror Universe 1v1 Quick Matches: Due to the randomness of the map in Dark Forest, fairness could not be guaranteed. We will use zero-knowledge to implement a symmetrical, relatively small-scale universe that makes 1v1 fair and quick competition possible.\r\n\r\nAcceleration of “move” operations: According to our in-depth analysis of on-chain data, the fastest player in Dark Forest can currently perform 8 on-chain operations in one minute, which is unimaginably slow in the traditional game experience. We can leverage some of underlying technologies of the blockchain to accelerate operations, including but not limited to the modification of the zero-knowledge proof scheme and the parallelization of the on-chain transaction.\r\n\r\nGame Strategy Evaluation Sandbox: Empowers advanced players to evaluate the excellence of their game strategies in a more quantitative way, including but not limited to fine-grained real-time data analysis, simulated opponent matchups against specific strategies, video replay analysis of past games, and more.\r\n\r\nWho are we? \r\n\r\nDfArchon is a newly established gaming group focused on Dark Forest, with three members currently. Our members are all blockchain developers, dedicated players of Dark Forest, and also have art design skills. \r\n\r\nWe are working on game strategy development, experience optimization from blockchain layer to client-side game, sandbox platform for game strategy evaluation, etc. More ecological projects are waiting to be discovered. \r\n\r\nThe DfArchon team has received a lot of help from the official Dark Forest Discord server, the Dark Forest Chinese community (especially the wechat group organized by keke.eth) and MarrowDAO during the process of getting to know the Dark Forest game. We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to those friends who have helped

- feature film about longevity -","slug":"methuselah-feature-film-about-longevity-","description":"Inspired by a true story, “Methuselah” is a new noir about Mia, a reporter who risks everything to find a cure for her son, who has cancer. She learns about the existence of a gene therapy that is able to cure cancer and other incurable diseases.. According to her sources, this therapy is only available to the elites. This information is reinforced by scientists’ fear of overpopulation. Later, Mia learns that the therapy is currently in the testing phase and that her “sources” will stop at nothing to block it from hitting the market. \r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS STORY IS INSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Problem:\r\nUp to this point, movies portrayed longevity as turning into a dystopia (for example, “In Time” with Justin Timberlake).\r\nThe longevity industry is trying to tell people how important this cause is, but we need to show, not tell, in order to reach mainstream audiences. There is a growing demand for a film that deals with longevity in a new and meaningful way. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Solution: \r\nOur goal is to offer a fresh, positive perspective on longevity. Right now, people associate longevity with a dystopian future. In order to change their perspective, we have to provide them some insights into gene therapy mixed with a touching story. The element of truthfulness adds even more depth to the project..The story is partly inspired by Elizabeth Parrish's efforts to find a cure for her sick son. An important figure in the longevity community, Elizabeth is both praised and envied by the community members for her courage and assertiveness. Also, the gene therapy serum is based on Jaime Guevara-Aguirre’s work. In the late ‘80s, he found an extended family in Ecuador who carried a gene mutation that prevents the body from using growth hormones. Around three hundred people worldwide have this mutation; one hundred of them in Ecuador. Why is this gene so special? Well, there was only one case of cancer and no cases of diabetes among the people who carry it, whereas 5% of Ecuadorians suffer from diabetes and 17% from cancer. The scientists exposed the human cells in a petri dish to blood serum taken from the people who carry the gene mutation. They found that their cells’ DNA were less likely to become damaged than DNA in cells exposed to regular blood serum. Also, when the DNA was damaged, the cells tended to self-destruct. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUse of funds:\r\nPreproduction development costs and casting. The aim is to have the seed money in order to get this movie started, afterwards our goal is to sign with one of the big distribution companies who can market the movie well, such as Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures, etc. \r\n\r\nTeam: \r\nWe intend to hire an international diverse cast, well established actors, a few recognizable faces and a renowned director. At this stage, we have on board a team of writers. \r\n\r\nWriter Gabriel Eduard Molnar is a finalist of the screenwriting contest \"Write a Screenplay for Sebastian Stan - Bucky Barnes from The Avengers\". He wrote the script for \"Back 2 Back\" (producers: Moshe Diamant, Eduard Irimia, Alain Depardieu) and the script \"She Wants Me Too\" (producers: Victor Miller - \"Friday the 13th\" and Steve Beswick - \"Legion\").  \r\n\r\nMadalina Bellariu Ion is an actress/producer. She appeared in the HBO TV series The Young Pope (alongside Jude Law), in a production directed by Oscar winning Italian director Paolo Sorrentino.She has recently finished filming a lead role in an American movie Last Known Whereabouts (distributed by Warner Bros). Madalina was also the protagonist of a Romanian drama series, which became the most viewed series on Antena 1 in 2020. In 2018, she co-starred in the OFFIE Nominated Off-West End stage production of black comedy The Gift of the Gab in London. Madalina is the lead in the Italian comedy Alice Non Lo Sa to be released next year in Italy. Other credits include: Pennyworth (Epix), Coronation Street (ITV), Dobaara: See Your Evil (an adaptation of the 2013 American horror film Oculus), For Love or Money, and Dampyr. As a producer she produced a short film “Bad Wings” ( soon to be out). \r\n\r\nWe are planing to sign with a distributor who can market the movie well in order to reach a mainstream audience.

DAO","slug":"reputable-dao","description":"Our Story\r\n\r\nWe started this mission to put an end to the wasted heart beats, money, and effort being thrown away in the health and wellness space. Trillions spent on unnecessary healthcare interventions and treatments. Novel therapies unadopted for decades, because of an outdated system.  \r\n\r\nProblem - Adoption is slow\r\n\r\nAdoption of new health & wellness innovations is painfully slow.  It can take 30 years for a new treatment to become standard of care.\r\n\r\nThe reason adoption is so slow, is because we lack a credible way to determine that one therapy or solution is 'better' than another. Without having a credible way to know what is better, adoption of new innovations are glacially slow. It can take decades for a new solution to become standard of care. ​  \r\n\r\nProblem - Who determines 'better'?\r\n\r\nThe 5-star review system is broken. Blackbox reputation scoring is sub-optimal. \r\nWe can't expect any single company to determine 'Better'.\r\n\r\nThe Need\r\n\r\nWe need a decentralized, federated approach to determine 'better'. One that is fully transparent, without the shackles of ownership. One where curation is prioritized over control. ​\r\n\r\nWhy this is important\r\n\r\nWe realized that it doesn't matter how much healthcare innovation is happening. If we can't solve for \"what's better?\", we're stuck. This is the status quo. Billions spent. Time wasted. Lives lost. Reputation is the lynchpin needed to unlock all the value created in health & wellness. ​ \r\n\r\nHow we solve this problem\r\n\r\nThis is a moon shot, but it is also solvable. It just needs like-minded individuals and organization to come onboard and push against the status quo.  We are building this community in Discord.  Please join us: https://discord.gg/DBtgTqvgAG\r\n\r\nReputable is a DAO.  What does that mean?\r\n\r\nIt means, Reputable:\r\nIs open for all to participate\r\nHas no single controlling entity\r\nShares benefits with all contributors\r\nHas no ambiguity in the rules.  We simply trust the code\r\nSmart contract code is 100% transparent and verifiable\r\nDecisions are governed by proposal and voting\r\n\r\nWhat the Gitcoin funds will be used for?\r\n\r\nWe will be using the funds to kick off Season 0 of Reputable.  In Season 0, we will be focused on the Supplement industry.  This is an industry that direly needs credible reputation.  \r\nFunds will be used to grow and incentivize a community of health and wellness enthusiasts collaborating on what makes a product or service credible/reputable.\r\n\r\nIs Reputable a public good?\r\n\r\nYes, the Reputable protocol, algorithms and data collected will be open sourced and a public good, with the intention of helping others build on top of our platform, so that we can all credibly determine 'better'.\r\n\r\nIs Reputable serving the longevity industry?\r\n\r\nYes, the longevity industry overlaps nicely with the

York Blockchain Coalition","slug":"new-york-blockchain-coalition","description":"Summary\nRegulation starts at the state level. We need to advocate now in the states that have growing anti-blockchain legislation to prevent it from influencing policy at the federal level. We have to start this lobbying process at the financial heart of the USA: New York State.\n\nAbout\nThere is a saying in policy making: “what happens in New York and California eventually becomes the policy of the country.” It is not untrue; whether it is education, legalization, or even fashion regulation, the trends set in the largest media markets in the country have ripple effects across the entire nation, turning local experiments and sentiments about industries into established narratives.\n\nThe narrative of the blockchain/crypto industry is not yet set but it is already starting to form in these markets. Powerful forces from a variety of industries are all beginning to have opinions on the blockchain/crypto industry as they begin to understand their relationship to it, and how its success (or failure) will help or hurt them and their priorities.\n\nFor this vital sector to survive, and not go the way of other disruptive, transformational industries, we need to start working at the local and state level, as well as the federal level to steer the direction of legislation and educate current and future legislators on the potential of the blockchain/crypto space.\n\nWhy Now?\nOther states and municipalities are also taking steps to create a more friendly environment for innovators in the blockchain space, leaving New York City and New York State potentially at a loss for future industry developments. This is a very real fear among legislators who care about the future of the state's innovation sector, but in the absence of a pro-blockchain voice, they will be influenced by the information coming from other sources they are familiar with, such as the green energy sector or anti-blockchain activists.\n\nHaving had previous success, educating and creating policies for elected officials around the blockchain industry, we propose creating the New York Blockchain Coalition (NYBCC) to create a dedicated organization whose sole purpose is educating legislators on the benefits of the blockchain, monitoring and responding to new legislation proposed, and serving as a point of contact for the blockchain professionals and enthusiasts in New York State. \n\nIt is unlikely that New York State will adopt similar laissez-faire policies as Wyoming, so we must take a proactive approach in shaping the industry so that an approach, guided by the people closest to the technology and invested in its widespread adoption, becomes the model nationwide. We are not starting from scratch: there are pro-blockchain forces at the state and city level. We need to create more allies, expand more people’s thinking, and fight back against the forces who want to paint a gross caricature of the industry as a useless, environment-destroying ponzi scheme (because they will fill the void this way if we do not create a narrative ourselves).\n\nThe Goal:\nWe hope to incorporate and fund a 501c4 organization dedicated solely to the public good of educating legislators on the benefits of the blockchain, monitoring and responding to new legislation proposed, and serving as a point of contact for the blockchain professionals and enthusiasts in New York State. We have registered lobbyists at the federal, city, and state levels who are ready and excited to get to work on the project and have experience in the industry as well as lobbying for New York State.\n\nHow We Get There:\nIf funded, we would build our coalition of companies, supportive organizations, et. al., and source directly from them the priorities for each legislative session and the appropriate actions to achieve these goals, reporting regularly on the progress and ‘insider baseball’ so that we might leverage the collective knowledge and resources of our community for its furtherance. This would translate into direct action events, social media and PR campaigns targeted at creating influence at crucial times, and even assisting in drafting policy white papers.\n\nWhy HZQ?\nHZQ specializes in engaging and highly targeted marketing campaigns around political races, advocacy around causes, and supporting non-profit’s in support of their missions. We have been successfully working with these for about 5 years and have learned a thing or two about effectively driving behavior change.\n\nAs stewards of this project, we will update the community

Unf_ck The Planet Together w/ Early-stage Climate Tech R&D","slug":"lets-unf_ck-the-planet-together-w-early-stage-cli","description":"A web3, community-driven initiative to fund, enable and support real world climate tech projects and R&D with a meaningful chance of unf_cking our planet.\r\n\r\nThe Problem\r\n\r\nIf our global economy continues on its current trajectory our planet is f_cked.\r\n​\r\nEvery year we release 51 billion tons of harmful, ecosystem-transforming, greenhouse gasses (GHG) into our atmosphere by burning fossil fuels. 99.9% of our scientists agree that we'll need to get to net zero GHG emissions by 2050 if we want to avoid a global catastrophe. \r\n \r\nThat means we’re going to have to decarbonize all areas of our economy. It’s going to be incredibly difficult to achieve this and we cant just rely on slow-moving world governments to cooperate and make it happen. If we're going to have any chance at all we're going to need ALL hands on deck. That includes individuals, scientists, engineers, startups, non-profits, NGOs, and even the large corporations that are responsible for most of the worlds GHG emissions.\r\n \r\nAs a society we need to accomplish something gigantic, something that we’ve never done before, and at a much faster pace than anything we've ever done. To accomplish this, we first need lots of breakthroughs in science and engineering. We then need to bring these technologies to market and scale them. All of this takes incredible amounts of expertise, effort, coordination, and capital. \r\n \r\nOne of the major roadblocks preventing new climate-focused technology development and deployment is that new projects and startups are incredibly difficult to fund at these early stages. There are several reasons for this but mainly they need much more time to develop their technology, get to market and scale than most venture capitalists are comfortable with. Many VCs and investors are looking for a fast and massive return on their investment and climate tech just takes longer. It took solar and wind power decades to reach economic viability but we didn’t see VC join in until it was proven and ready to scale. We could’ve had these technologies much sooner if we had more funding for early stage climate tech ventures. \r\n \r\nAs a society we’ve made lots of progress thus far but we’re going to need many more shots on goal, technological breakthroughs and a wartime mentality aimed at developing and scaling them. Without these things we won’t be able to avoid a climate catastrophe.\r\n\r\nOur Solution\r\n\r\nWe need breakthroughs and we need to get them to market fast. The success rate of financing and bringing new tech to market, especially in the climate space, is very low. There are many reasons why these projects & startups fail. Reasons include: not raising enough capital, not validating the market need (i.e. product-market fit), inability to pivot the business or product, and poor execution overall. If we're going to have any chance of getting breakthrough technologies to market we're going to need as many shots on goal as we can get. One of the best models for this is the 'startup studio' model.\r\n​\r\nA startup studio is essentially an organization that builds startups. After lots of research and validation the studio incubates projects into potential startups and spins them out into the world when they're ready. The common goal among studios is to experiment with lots of projects, welcome failure, and strive for several successful spinouts. Some studios are generalists and some are specialists - ours will specialize in climate tech across several categories including energy, transportation, carbon capture and web3. The goal of the studio is to quickly identify problems & ideate, rapidly validate solutions, develop minimum viable products (MVPs), test them with potential customers, find traction and spin the individual companies out once they reach meaningful commercial traction and market validation. \r\n \r\nThe studio structure enables many more shots on goal at solving our climate crisis.\r\n\r\nOur founder has close to a decade in the climate tech sector and most recently ran a hardware startup he founded focused on recovering otherwise-wasted kinetic energy from vehicles on roadways in order to produce clean electricity locally for EV charging stations.\r\n\r\nOur plan to fund the studio\r\n\r\nTo fund the studio initially, and begin operating, we've recently launched an NFT collection (minted on Polygon a much more climate-friendly, and Ethereum-compatible chain) with ALL proceeds going towards funding early stage climate tech R&D projects with a meaningful chance of unf_cking our planet. \r\n\r\nWhile the collection should be enough the bootstrap the studio into startup mode, our concern is that the proceeds likely won't be enough to sustain the studio for any meaningful amount of time. To add to this, we have yet to sell our first NFT from the collection. We realize we're still very early and are optimistic that we will gain traction but it's going to take a monumental effort to get the flywheel moving. It's even harder to bring awareness when you only have ~100 followers on Twitter and don't have many connections in the web3/NFT space.\r\n\r\nThe reason we are setting up the grant, and asking that you join our mission, is that we feel with your help we can fund the initial bootstrap/startup of the studio and begin putting a professional level of effort into bringing awareness to our project and fundraising campaign.\r\n\r\nUse of Proceeds\r\n\r\nAll proceeds (from both the grant and the collection) will go towards building a core team, hiring expert advisors, R&D, product development, market research & validation, beta/pilot testing with early customers and everything else an early stage climate tech startup needs to be setup for success.\r\n\r\nA little goes a long way. For example, with only $3,600 we could set up shop for 6 months in an amazing co-working/makerspace in Brooklyn, NY for frontier tech startups with tons of amenities around prototyping, new product development and small run manufacturing. Around 25% of the startups in there are climate tech focused and growing.\r\n\r\nIn addition, for each NFT purchase, at least 1 metric ton (2,204 lbs) of greenhouse gasses will be offset on behalf of every holder. That is the equivalent of avoiding 1,100 pounds of coal burned and released into the atmosphere. This will be accomplished via carbon offset purchases through reputable entities such as Terrapass or Native Energy. If we can sell out the entire collection that would offset 431,986 lbs of GHG. This doesn’t factor in the future GHG reduction that will be enabled by the projects that spin out of the studio into the world. If successful, they will be responsible for several orders of magnitude more GHG reductions at scale.\r\n\r\nSee project website for full list of benefits to collectors both now and in the future\r\n\r\nhttps://www.unf-cktheplanet.com\r\n\r\nFuture Plans\r\n\r\nWe plan to evolve the project into a DAO focused on creating, validating and funding early stage climate tech startups via tokenized equity and a staking pool - details to be worked out as our community develops around the project. This DAO will enable individuals to contribute to startups that are aiming to solve the climate crisis and, in return, receive tokenized equity. Our DAO will enable contributors to get involved at the earliest stages in a fledgeling startup’s life when all of the growth is up ahead, and way before an IPO.\r\n\r\nWe have to start somewhere, but

PLANET - Create the planet you want","slug":"pozzle-planet-create-the-planet-you-want","description":"The only digital world built by taking action in the real world, Pozzle $Planet is a social-game, and sits at the intersection of 3 main growth trends in social, gaming and crypto, with a unique value proposition as the first impact-2-earn business model.\r\n\r\nThe Pozzle Planet game-app enables players & friends to join activities via video that make a real-life positive impact here on Planet Earth, whilst at the same time earning $POZ tokens and generating a PozzleVerse full of NFTs called Pozzles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreating miracles✨ of the commons \r\nOver-consumption, spending, production, emissions, the list goes on. An exclusive part of the world holds abundance, the majority struggle, and a small portion works in scarcity to do better in the handover of our world. \r\n\r\nToday, there's often no incentive for individuals to hold themselves back from taking too much.\r\nWe've forgotten that we are part of a whole that is connected. The common benefit benefits us all individually, while the individual benefit can harm us all in common. Through our actions, we are not acknowledging that our pursuit of personal gain leads to negative impact on Planet Earth, which in turn is to all of our detriment.\r\n\r\nThose very few early pioneers who have actually been to space and have experienced 'the astronaut overview' in witnessing the fragility of our planet, understand that this is it. There is no Planet B.\r\n \r\nWe seek to provide the 'astronaut overview' for all of our pilots in the Pozzle universe, by creating a world in which global positive impact drives the prosperity of our planet. We look to turn the scales of power to those who wish to leave the planet a little better than how you got it.\r\n \r\nWe are on a mission to make $POZ a meaningful crypto that increases the value of good actions over bad, and brings prosperity for planet Earth and all its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n$POZ is a crypto with an impact beyond currency. Through the Pozzle Planet game app, $POZ gives value to everyday activities by everyday people that make our (real) world a better place. Any activity that can have a real-life positive impact on a moment, a day, a life, the planet, or the world around us, is rewarded with $POZ. We call this our impact-to-earn model, which has the vast potential to give meaningful income to anyone making a positive impact through Pozzle Planet.\r\n\r\nPozzle $Planet is a global community that knows that one small action leads to another. We believe in the collective power of all of us to accelerate the sustainability revolution, and we aim to use optimism and kindness to inspire millions of people to do tiny actions that collectively add up to a huge impact.\r\n\r\nBy 2025, we aim to ignite and enable billions of small positive actions that contribute to reversing the detrimental trends and put us on track to accelerate the flourishing and prosperity of everyone, people and planet.\r\n\r\nProof of Concept \r\nWe are building Pozzle Planet on the back of launching a web2 short-form video social app called Impactr, taking it from market research to MVP launch in 2020, and completing a successful private beta with 400+ beta testers across 5 months in 2021 with a waitlist of +3000 users. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur beta showed clear proof of concept on the social engine and 'ripple feature' (people creating long chains of video documenting sustainable life hacks), with weekly retention +45%, +35% engagement/users posting videos, and unlocking a new creator segment, as +50% of the core active users indicated to rarely post video content on existing platforms.   \r\n\r\nPre-Season\r\nWe are currently in our Pre-Season, which means an early stage of Pozzle Planet where we are running initiatives that lead up to the full launch of the Pozzle Planet app to App Store and Google Play in early 2022.\r\n\r\nWe have recently completed our Hello World and published our white-paper, $POZ token is minted and initially airdropped to the impactr beta community, we launched our Starter Pack program for newcomers to Pozzle Planet, ignited our Build-2-Earn program, app design completed, prototyped and is currently being built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoadmap 2021-2022\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTeam  \r\nOur International team have a combined 30+ years of experience working in the sustainability space with backgrounds in software engineering, sociology, renewable energy, finance, app and business development, fundraising, design and creative industry. The team has worked together for the past 18 months, and previously soft launched Pozzle Planet's predecessor Impactr.\r\n\r\nAs part of our pre-season activities we have formed a Guild to support the core teams work with building the Pozzle Planet game-app and expand the Pozzleverse. We have issued the first 20 million $POZ tokens up for grabs as part of our annual build-2-earn program. Guild members earn $POZ by contributing to code, digital design, game-systems, engineering, creative, operations, documents or any other building blocks of the PozzleVerse - join us!\r\n\r\nGovernance\r\nPozzle $Planet's development is currently owned and governed by the founders of Impactr LLC/APS, but our vision is to  transition into a DAO structure as the project and platform matures over the next couple of seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoin our Discord:https://discord.gg/my994s5X/\r\n\r\nUPDATE  📈\r\n\r\nWe are excited to share the detailed outcomes of several

Castles -  Portable and modular miniverses","slug":"moving-castles-portable-and-modular-miniverses","description":"Moving Castles is developing portable and modular miniverses towards a federated and open metaverse. This grant is to contribute to open source development and documentation.\n\nIn a collaboration with Trust, we will in early 2022 launch Portal Arc: a series of three reoccurring stream formats that explore world-building, knowledge games, governance games and cross-community gameplay using Discord, Metamask/WalletConnect and Twitch integrations with Unreal engine. For this first MVP (see diagram here) we will establish the core primitive functions of Moving Castles towards our vision of a federated metaverse (see diagram here).\n\nMoving Castles is developed according to the following principles:\nCollective: Many contributors share control through transparent and real-time governance mechanisms.\nPortable: To avoid lock-in mechanisms, Moving Castles have the ability to move freely between platforms, standards and protocols.\nModular: Communities should have the ability to construct Moving Castles by creating, importing, and arranging composable parts (such as avatars, props and environments) together as a coherent whole while making these parts available for others to reuse and adapt.\nInteroperable: They have the ability to interact with other communities; communicating, playing games, and sharing knowledge & skills in order to help these communities become Moving Castles themselves.\n\nOur initial prototype will feature:\n3 games produced using Unreal Engine and controlled by Discord & Twitch users, testing key functions of the Moving Castles thesis.\nIdentity layer for off-chain inventory (items, votes), onchain assets (Tokens, NFTs) and Unreal access control connecting Metamask, WalletConnect, Twitch & Discord\nThree inventory primitives: community scale, group scale and individual agent scale, and their avatar representations.\n\nWe will collaborate with 5 3D artists and 3 additional developers for this first MVP. You can find our initial post on Moving Castles on the Gitcoin blog, and an extended version here.

DAO: Decentralizing Ocean Conservation","slug":"moonjelly-dao-decentralizing-ocean-conservation","description":"What is a Moonjelly? \n\nThe jellyfish Aurelia Aurita is the world’s only biologically immortal creature: These animals hang out in oceans around the world and can turn back time by reverting to an earlier stage of their life cycle. We believe in the restorative super powers of nature and we’re here to allow this process to take place for the oceans. \n\nWho are We?\n\nMoonjelly DAO is decentralizing ocean conservation: building a new financial impact model where the world profits from restoring the wild living ocean. We understand that no approach to halting climate change can succeed without the ocean:  Ocean action is Climate Action. \n\nHow it Works: \n\nOur mission is to steward a system that rewards ocean impact, socially and economically, building a worldwide community of ocean impact doers across our impact verticals selected by top ocean scientists: Climate change, Habitat destruction, Biodiversity loss, Industrial waste water and agriculture pollution, Unsustainable fisheries, Illegal wildlife trade, Plastic Pollution, Shipping & Posidonia. \n\nTo achieve this Moonjelly DAO has based our technical approach on three pillars: sustainable treasury, maintaining verified impact creation, and providing funding to projects generating the biggest impact for the ocean. \n\nOur current iteration is a Grants DAO- projects apply for funding from the DAO, expert committees vet projects for feasibility, our community votes on which  projects to receive funding and projects undergo full verification.  But we are not stopping there. Keep an eye out for our whitepaper launch in January 2022 for a deeper dive into the innovative tokenomics of profitable impact. \n\nThe Ocean and Climate : \n\n“The ocean plays a critical role in the global climate system. Not only does the ocean take in an estimated 93% of the heat trapped by rising GHG levels, it also absorbs approximately 25-30% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions while producing about half of the earth’s oxygen through the photosynthetic activity of marine plants and algae. The risks to our ocean and coastlines from climate change are well publicised, including potentially catastrophic sea-level rise impacting many millions of people around the world, continued acidification decimating marine life, and disruption of the ocean’s temperature gradient and typical flow patterns that could have enormous world-wide impacts on weather systems.\n\nThe potential of the ocean for accelerating decarbonisation, however, merits increased priority in the global climate-change discourse. The High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy (HLP), a multilateral group comprising representatives from 14 oceanic countries, estimates that by 2050 ocean-based climate mitigation and carbon storage options from healthy marine ecosystems could make up 21% of the emissions reductions needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C.7 Put differently, this equates to more than all current global emissions from coal-fired power plants worldwide” - Economist Impact (https://ocean.economist.com/innovation/articles/checking-in-on-ocean-basedclimate-solutions)\n\nJoin the Community! \n\nDiscord

X Crypto Masterminds","slug":"impact-x-crypto-masterminds","description":"Passionate about making a positive social or climate impact and the potential of crypto, but don’t know where to start? \r\n\r\nAlready contributing to an amazing project, and looking to level up your impact by learning from and supporting like-minded peers? \r\n\r\nJoin an Impact X Crypto Mastermind group of talented, hard-working people just like you, who will encourage and support you in achieving your Impact and Crypto goals. \r\n\r\nKnow a rising star that would greatly benefit from this? Sponsor them! \r\n\r\nWhy does this matter?\r\n\r\nIf you’ve been in crypto for a while, think back to what you were feeling just before you dove in. For many that I’ve had the privilege to speak with, this process took a lot longer than desired and involved a lot of normal fear and anxiety from joining a new community.\r\n\r\nAs open and inviting as many DAOs are, many incredibly talented people are not used to being listened to and speaking up and for themselves, particularly when you don’t know anyone. If we’re going to solve the enormous climate and social impact challenges ahead of us, we need to create mechanisms for EVERYONE to participate.\r\n\r\nDAOs may have already made enormous progress on the structural barriers to entry, but there’s a lot more to do on the social barriers to entry. Let’s create systems, structures, and communities that are welcoming and accessible to everyone, no matter their background or circumstances.\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n\r\nIn the days following the close of this grant, I’ll send out a simple survey to you and all the other contributors and sponsored participants to facilitate group formation. Survey will collect information about:\r\nGoals for joining group, & what you can contribute\r\nCurrent circumstances and brief background\r\nMeeting frequency and timing preferences, and other logistics\r\nRequest to be paired with a friend, and/or to remain anonymous\r\n\r\nMastermind Groups of 4-7 people meet online according to their preferred frequency, and create a space dedicated to supporting each other achieve their common goals. Participants will offer you and each other new perspectives, resources, and connections in support of each others’ challenges. Maybe most importantly, you’ll be surrounded by people that know what you’re going through. They get it.\r\n\r\nMy role: An ICF coach is not a teacher; closer to a facilitator. Coaching is an effective method for helping people quickly re-frame, shift perspective, and redefine themselves and their situations. As a coach, I’m a co-pilot in the conversation, bringing questions and encouragement that draw out the very best contributions from the full group.\r\n\r\nVision: Where it’s going\r\n\r\nThis is just the start. While it may be possible to go faster or directly to the end, the goal is to form a community around common values of deep faith in people, community, and emergence.\r\n\r\nIf you want to go fast, go alone; but if you want to go far, go together. \r\n\r\nPhase 1:\r\nLaunch onboarding & matching survey\r\nNomination conversations within suggested DAOs\r\nGroup meetings begin in January!\r\nLaunch Discord server for community to share learnings, experiences, and self-organize\r\nRegular updates on progress here and via twitter\r\n\r\nPhase 2:\r\nUsing learnings from Phase 1, fine tune sessions format and messaging\r\nRoll out “coaching groups” where participants’ common goal is to prepare to host groups themselves\r\nRoll out dedicated comms channels and people to support that\r\n\r\nPhase 3:\r\nLaunch a DAO around the community, with the singular purpose of making Impact through DAOs accessible to everyone. Exact final wording and other details TBD by the community\r\nCoaching and Mentoring matchmaking!\r\n\r\nAbout me\r\n\r\nHi! I’m Daryl Edwards, an ICF-trained leadership coach, dedicated to the self-leadership growth of social and climate entrepreneurs and changemakers. I’m an Engineer, have an MBA, and am a certified coach with 20 years of international social entrepreneurial and coaching experience, leading diverse teams in dozens of countries. As an example, I was general manager of a social enterprise shoe factory in Peru, growing 5x in people and 7x in revenue in just 3.5 years.\r\n\r\nWhat people say: [with permission; anonymized to respect privacy]\r\n\r\n\t“I can already feel myself growing towards the goals that I set out to accomplish with Daryl. His approach to following me through sessions with purposeful curiosity has created a safe and productive space for me.”\r\n\r\n\t\"I can truly say that I'm not the same person I was before Daryl and I started working together. He is so gifted in meeting people where they're at and developing them to their fullest potential.\" \r\n\r\n\t\"Working with Daryl meant experiencing the power of remembering who I am and all the resources I have within to conquer personal and professional objectives. I experienced a shift in my perspective of myself that has brought a new level of internal empowerment required to pursue my goals.\"\r\n\r\n\t\"If you want to achieve realistic and measurable outcomes, begin your work with Daryl sooner rather than later. Daryl asks the right questions that enable you to get to the crux of what you want, why you want it and how you might get it. I developed a detailed action plan in regards to my 2021 business goals including new services, website content and more to make my business more client-focused and growth-driven.\"\r\n\r\nI’m making a minimum 3 month commitment to dedicate at least 50% of my professional time to this project, no matter the results of this grant. Please contribute generously so it can be much more!\r\n\r\nHave Questions? Ideas? Get in Touch\r\n\r\nI want to hear from you!

Mafia Game: Hackers vs. Devs","slug":"zk-mafia-game-hackers-vs-devs","description":"A Zero Knowledge game of Mafia pitting anonymous hackers against a heroic band of developers battling for the future of Web3.\n\nWhat\nWe're bringing the classic social deduction party game of Mafia (aka Werewolves) to life in zero knowledge.\n\nGame Story\nAn anonymous cabal of hackers have been exploiting Web3 projects and draining their funds. To save the Web3 ecosystem, a heroic group of top developers has joined forces to fight back. They've formed HackNone, an organization dedicated to hunting down Web3 hackers.\n\nBut HackNone has just received a tip! There are hackers masquerading amongst their members.\n\nThe honest devs must catch the hackers among them and vote to expel them from the organization. Unfortunately, because only the best devs are allowed as members, if a dev's project is exploited, that dev will be kicked out and banned from future votes.\n\nWill the devs catch the hackers in time before their own projects are exploited? Or will the hackers take over HackNone and bring the Web3 world to its knees?\n\nGameplay\nThe game plays out much like the original game of Mafia, with Devs instead of Villagers, Hackers instead of the Mafia, and an Auditor instead of a Detective.\n\nThe biggest difference is that in ZK Mafia, secret identities will be randomly assigned and kept truly secret without the need for a trusted moderator to run the game. Hackers will remain hidden as they attack Dev after Dev. Daytime votes to remove members will only be publicly revealed once all votes are received.\n\nCheck out our website (coming soon) for more details on game mechanics.\n\nWhy\nZK Mafia provides a case study of the power of zero knowledge technology that is fun and accessible to a wider and less technical audience.\n\nCan you build it without ZK? Yes. \nCan you build it better with ZK? 100%\nWe believe those 2 lines foreshadow our collective technological future, so let's build!\n\nHow\nThis is a new project, so some things are still being hashed out, but ZK Mafia will be on Layer 2, on either StarkNet or Aztec to take advantage of the scalability and privacy options afforded by ZK Rollups.\n\nAztec's L2 offers privacy by default, which simplifies the implementation, but they're still on testnet. StarkNet, on the other hand, just launched their shiny new Alpha version! However, because StarkNet doesn't support privacy out of the box, we'd have to use their ZK-STARK prover& verifier Ziggy.\n\nWe'll play with both and see which one we like more for this project. The more granular implementation details will be decided as we build.\n\nIf you're a zk afficionado, we welcome any ideas, feedback, or suggestions!\n\nWho: grjte\nHello, I'm grjte! I like to build things.\n\nIn meatspace, I'm a person who has done things and even won things, but around here I'm a new pseudonymous entity. I began a deep dive into ZK on October 26th at the beginning of ZK Hack, using it as a personal bootcamp. Despite entering without any significant background in ZK or Cryptography, I won 2 of the puzzle writeups, and now I'm diving into building. My aim in the ZK space is to start with smaller, fun projects and work my way up to Bigger And More Serious Things.\n\nFor more about me, here's a madlib bio which is honest with the correct inputs:\nI've been coding for over (_number_) (_time interval_)s. I've worked on backends, frontends, and compilers, for both public and private institutions. I've coded in (_number_) programming languages, including JavaScript/TypeScript, Solidity, and most recently dipping my toe into Rust. As an entrepreneur, I've run or founded (_number_) companies. I'm happiest when I'm learning and creating.\n\ngrjte, why is your github (nearly) empty?\nI care deeply about privacy, which is part of what has driven me to join the ZK ecosystem. I've decided to hang out here pseudonymously, which means building up a new github and reputation from scratch ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nWish me luck, or contribute and help me do it faster 😉\n\nWho:

ZK Mechanics in Dark Forest","slug":"community-led-zk-mechanics-in-dark-forest","description":"Dark Forest is a blockchain-native, real-time strategy game. It is the first on-chain game to incorporate incomplete information (known as \"fog of war\"), thanks to zero knowledge proofs. MarrowDAO's recent community round demonstrated the interoperable nature of Dark Forest by modifying the original Solidity contracts to add dynamic gameplay. We are DF community members who plan to go even further by researching and implementing new Dark Forest mechanics based on zkSNARKs, a zero knowledge technology.\r\n\r\nHere are some ideas we can't wait to get started on:\r\n\r\nA Battle Royale in which the universe shrinks and only one player/team can win.\r\n\r\nA marketplace that lets players trade items only if they are near the coordinates of the market. This will make certain coordinates or \"land\" valuable within a game space. Think hidden resource generators and NPCs that will automatically trade with you.\r\n\r\nA \"capture the flag\" game round in which teams capture enemy planets and defend their own.\r\n\r\nA new edgeless, wrap around universe.\r\n\r\nWho are we?\r\n\r\nkevinz917\r\n\r\nProof of concept for zk-vending machine, a prototype for a location-specific barter system.\r\nFramework for 🛸 spaceship-mod, an on-chain, interoperable game asset.\r\n\r\ncha0sg0d\r\n\r\nCo-founder of dfdao\r\nBuilt the Astral Colossus, a collaborative smart contract in Dark Forest\r\n\r\nhenryacaron\r\n\r\nA Developer's Blueprint of Zero Knowledge Proofs (blog post in progress)\r\nBlockchain Stratego, a proof of concept incomplete information game\r\n\r\nThis grant will allow us to support ourselves while

- bringing NFT minting to WordPress","slug":"web3wp-bringing-nft-minting-to-wordpress","description":"We are creating the de facto Web3 integration for WordPress, with a suite of tools that enable Web3 technologies for 43% of all websites. Our first feature is simply a way for content creators (the ones that power almost half of the world's websites!) to mint NFTs directly from within their WordPress CMS. 'Publish' becomes 'Publish and Mint'.\n\nWeb3 WP is developing projects that introduce the WordPress community to the decentralized future of the Internet. Where Blockchain, dApps, DAOs, NFTs, and Crypto meet GPL. The Web3 WP team has decades of experience in the WordPress open source project & ecosystem. We have a grand vision matched with a pragmatic approach.\n\n\n\nOur community is bringing Web3 to WordPress with a three-fold strategy:\n\n\n\nThis grant will go towards funding our Web3 integration plugin. While the initial release will start by building a native NFT minting experience inside WordPress, we don't plan to stop there!\n\nHere is a partial roadmap of planned features:\nNFT embedding in

Bublitz - ETH/ZK Infrastructure & Ecosystem developer","slug":"blaine-bublitz-ethzk-infrastructure-ecosystem-dev","description":"Blaine Bublitz builds infrastructure for ETH/ZK application development. He also collaborates closely with the Dark Forest team and other 0xPARC-adjacent projects.\r\nBlaine is a developer who is excited about web tech, open source, the future of decentralized virtual worlds, and ZK applications. He got hooked during the first public round of Dark Forest and has been building in the ZK application ecosystem ever since. Some of his work includes:\r\n\r\nZK Tooling and hardhat-circom\r\n\r\nIn collaboration with Jacob Rosenthal, Blaine helped to rewrite Dark Forest's zkSNARK build processes. This work was generalized into the hardhat-circom plugin, a configurable hardhat plugin which provides developers with a set of ZK circuit build tasks, and adds typescript declarations for snarkjs. Future work includes updating hardhat-circom to be compatible with circom2, and adding support for PLONK.\r\n\r\nContributions to circom & snarkjs\r\n\r\nBlaine contributes to circom and snarkjs on a regular basis. He’s provided patches to reduce the bundle build by 50% and has been doing work to enable WebWorker support.\r\n\r\nDark Forest Community Plugins Homepage\r\n\r\nBlaine built infrastructure for Dark Forest players to write, share, and discover third-party Dark Forest plugins. He also wrote several particularly useful/popular plugins, including the Remote Miner, Map Export, and Artifactory.\r\n\r\nProject Sophon\r\n\r\nAs one half of Project Sophon, Blaine open sources many experiments related to Dark Forest or other ZK ecosystem projects, such as darkforest-local, Broadcast market, and DF plugin-dev-server.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlaine's work on Dark Forest is now supported by grants from the Dark Forest core team.

- Web3 education platform","slug":"unfate-web3-education-platform","description":"\n\nWhat is Unfate?\n\nUnfate is the educational platform dedicated to Web3. I currently have more than 480 early access subscribers waiting for the launch of the platform with great enthusiasm.\n\nWhen I started DeFi I’ve made a lot of mistakes, lost funds because I didn’t know how to use MetaMask, didn’t know how to use Decentralized Exchanges, and got into obvious Ponzi Schemes. It would have been amazing if I had a dedicated learning platform that I could use and prevent me these mistakes.\n\nThe goal of Unfate is to primarily give people a top Web3 Education through a platform with an incredible User Experience and High-Quality Courses(DeFi, NFT, Gaming, DAOs, and more).\n\nStudents who finished a course with a passing score will be rewarded with an NFT certification. Engaged students can also be rewarded through a partnership with protocols, it might be a rare NFT or Tokens.\n\n\n\nWhy Gitcoin Grants?\n\n3 months ago, I’ve started the UX design then coded Unfate with no funding at all. I’ve progressed a lot on the project and almost finished the platform. But I have great difficulty finding high-quality educators and incentivizing them to create step-by-step full courses.\n\nThe Gitcoin grant would help me fund courses that the community students are interested to learn about. Here are some examples of courses:\n   - Basics of Decentralized Finance\n   - Mastering Decentralized Exchanges\n   - Beginner to Advanced on Stablecoins\n   - Play-To-Earn Gaming\n   - Mastering Decentralized Governance\n   - Passive Income with Yield Farming\n   - NFT for Culture and Property\n\n\n\nLinks & Social Media\n\n   - Landing Page: https://unfate.co\n   - Course Platform(currently

Tokens: Invest in a Scarce living being through NFTs and foster its survival","slug":"endangered-tokens-invest-in-a-scarce-living-being","description":"About\r\nThe Endangered Tokens (ENTS) Foundation is an ecosystem in which landowners; NGO’s, investors, artists and local communities actively collaborate with biodiversity preservation through the tokenization & conservation of Endangered Species.\r\n \r\n \r\nOur Mission is to form a decentralized investment community for biodiversity preservation, giving value and governance to stakeholders through Crypto Assets.\r\n \r\n \r\nAs humans we need to revalue biodiversity and living ecosystems through the preservation of Endangered Species, which are invaluable assets to society. This future is possible with the support of decentralized economies driven by self-sustainable and healthy ecosystems in which the community collaborates to generate the appropriate incentives towards creating a better world.\r\n \r\n \r\nThe Identified Problem\r\n \r\nEndangered species are part of complex ecosystems that have become fragile due to human activity, which leads to a lack of biodiversity. Their preservation is expensive since there are almost no incentives for landowners and authorities to preserve them, and instead have become liabilities (because their maintenance doesn't bring relevant revenue). NGOs often struggle to finance conservation activities.\r\n \r\n \r\nHow can we solve it? \r\n \r\nWe want to return the natural value to Endangered Species and biodiversity through the tokenization of living specimens endangered species and generate a global decentralized economic ecosystem of tradable assets and incentives to promote its survival and reproduction through the collaboration and engagement of the community. Thus acquiring value to stakeholders through the natural scarcity of the species, art, gaming, tourism, environmental education, local sustainable development, and carbon credits.\r\n \r\n \r\nWe are already working with Chilean local communities, NGOs, and Landowners on overcoming the difficulties and gaps in the Queule (Gomortega keule) conservation, an endangered endemic Chilean tree, through the tokenization of Queule specimens, community engagement, local innovation and Conservation Programs.\r\n \r\nWithin the first tokenization process we worked alongside NGO \"Costa Sur\" and effectively cadastred 26 Queules. These tokens will be marketed in order to find the worthy godparents of these 26 endangered Queule trees and raise funds to locate and preserve the 4000 last remaining living specimens of Queules in the world and other endangered species within their ecosystem. The 26 georeferenced tokens locations are only going to be available to the owners, when the verification process is complete and they will be granted the right to visit the tree in real life.  \r\n \r\nWe are already collaborating with local artists in order to create a collection of Pixel Art trees so that more people can become stakeholders of the ecosystem.

projects with an emphasis on \"core benefits\" such as biodiversity, ecosystem services and climate justice.  \n\nOur real asset projects create restoration, regeneration & conservation at scale, basin to basin.\n\nbasin is heavily involved in the ReFi movement (Regenerative Finance) and is working closely with other DAO's in the emerging ReFi DAO to DAO ecosystem. \n\nTo scratch our own itch, basin is building the open source basin.protocol to put real property rights (in our case for Regenerative Finance) on chain. We see a world where incentives and value exchanges that create a more healthy, abundant, balanced and peaceful world are quickly and easily shared between composable EVM's and multiple chains.  basin wants to contribute as much as possible and play an integral part in building the money lego's for ReFi and the money of the future.\n\nIf you have questions about where we are and our next steps,

educates lawmakers on crypto, DeFi and DAOs","slug":"cryptolaw-educates-lawmakers-on-crypto-defi-and-d","description":"Uninformed regulations harm the crypto space. We have a lot of work to do to change the tide of misinformation around crypto, DeFi and DAOs.\r\n\r\nFUD has taken hold of leaders outside the crypto world. Lawmakers repetitively labelling crypto or DeFi as nothing more than the Wild West. The powers-that-be in TradFi throwing oil on the fire by lamenting ‘unfair competition’ from unregulated crypto entities or decentralized networks.\r\n\r\nWe need to show how crypto, DeFi and DAOs can help achieve regulatory goals. Reducing transaction costs, lowering barriers to entry, mitigating information asymmetry and reducing agency costs in governance – these are the concepts lawmakers and regulators are very familiar with. We need to speak their language to explain how crypto can contribute to achieving those goals.\r\n\r\nThat’s our strength at CryptoLaw. We speak legalese. And we’ve studied the theory of the firm, law & economics, financial and behavioural game theory, corporate law, financial market regulation and competition law. And, of course, DeFi, DAOs, DLT and crypto in general. \r\n\r\nCryptoLaw was founded by a former practising lawyer and legal academic, with the ability to bridge the world of crypto and that of lawmakers. Ann Sofie started doing this by teaching a course on crypto & law at Cambridge, but it’s time to bring that knowledge to a wider audience: those deciding on the legal fate of crypto, DeFi and DAOs.\r\n\r\nThe crypto community has great teams doing excellent crypto advocacy work. Coin Center has been doing important work around the Infrastructure Bill while EFF is carrying out crucial advocacy work on privacy rights. CryptoLaw complements those efforts with a focused legal contribution, including by: \r\nputting basic legal questions around crypto in a broader context,\r\nexplaining DeFi and DAOs through concepts and theories that regulators understand,\r\nshowing how money lego’s and decentralized networks can help lawmakers in their quest to break the stronghold of Big Tech and return control over our personal data to us, \r\nemphasizing that privacy and pseudonymity an opportunity rather than a threat.\r\n\r\nWith your help, CryptoLaw can educate lawmakers, regulators, policymakers… and the general public while we’re at it. This grant will be used for a variety of educational tools. We already have a few interviews on DeFi & regulatory aims (including with SEC Commissioner Peirce; and one with EU Commission Principal Economist Dr. Joachim Schwerin) and we want to add more. A Gitcoin grant will also help branch out to DAO topics, such as governance. We also want to contribute to crypto education and advocacy for our target audience of lawmakers through a series of explainer videos – for example, explaining the differences between counterparty risk in TradFi and AMMs, explaining how on-chain transparency can help achieve the aims of traditional disclosure rules, or explaining how DAOs offer a different way to pool resources to create value while mitigating agency costs.  \r\n\r\nWith your support, we can help stem the tide of legal FUD. There is still time to prevent a threatening wave of uninformed, restrictive rules.

A ZK Powered Social Coordination Game","slug":"brush-a-zk-powered-social-coordination-game","description":"Brush is a on-chain game set on a large canvas-like world, inspired by Reddit's r/place. The large canvas will be populated with different color dyes at the onset, and users will race to harvest those dyes. After harvesting, players can \"craft\" different pictures using those dyes on a canvas, snapshot those pictures, and sell them as NFTs. Dyes will be used as the base resource for both crafting and trading. Think NPC powered AMMs, in-game loans, etc. \n\nWe hope that this game will create complex social dynamics such as a faction monopolizing one color dye and trading them to other clans to build beautiful picture. We also hope to explore some sort of \"remixing\" ability where one can remix and build on top of other images at some cost like Blitmap's overlay. \n\nWe're also particularly excited about the idea of a fully private user inventory powered by zero-knowledge proofs that allow users to craft items but not reveal what they hold to other users. ZK can also be enforce locality and check if a user is within a certain range of a dye producer. For instance, one might be able to collect more dye if they're closer to a dye generation hidden on the map. \n\nThe game will be experimented on Starkware to start.

DAO","slug":"say-dao","description":"For the past few years, we have been on a mission to design a decentralized, multi-component and open-source platform called SAY to study and propose solutions to the challenges we face regarding poverty.\n\nIn 2018 we started developing the first component, which focuses on providing children with their daily/educational requirements. Since 2019, we have been testing, learning and redesigning this first piece. Today, SAY is a stable platform supporting Afghan and Iranian children in deprived regions of Iran and is shifting to become a DAO on the Ethereum blockchain to reach millions of children.\n\nElevator pitch:\nSAY is a network governed by a community that gathers data from children in poverty and provides them with their daily/educational requirements by leveraging existing NGOs and supply chain infrastructures. \n\n\nWhat is SAY:\nSAY enables NGOs and charities to register children on a secure and accessible database and regularly update children's status, daily or educational needs.\n On the other hand, participants in our community get randomly matched to a child's profile that holds a unique avatar representing the child along with their non-fictional short life story and the recorded child's voice SAYing whatever they desire. Users virtually adopt those specific children by choosing roles such as mother, aunt, father, and uncle. These virtual families take care of their children's short and long-term needs through eCommerce links collaboratively or individually. \n\nHow it works:\n1- Authorized social workers register children in our app. ( These children are located in NGO/charity/Government camps/Shelters/Orphanages, ...) \n2- Social workers regularly update children's needs from daily requirements such as nutrition to long-term needs such as education.\n3- Users use SAY APP to register and search for a random child \n4-After finding the child, users choose a role: mother, father, aunt, uncle, etc., to adopt them virtually and create/join a virtual family.\n5- Virtual families use micro-donation to take care of their children's requirements listed by social workers individually or collectively.\n(They either buy the product from independent online retailers through our app, like buying a jacket or send their donation directly to NGO, i.e. for school transportation)\n6- virtual families receive confirmation receipts/reports at every step to make everything more transparent.\n\n\nToken Economy:\nWe are in the R&D stage to create the model and then propose a sustainable token economy. NFT and Governance tokens will be an essential part of our ecosystem.\nHowever, today SAY sustains its ecosystem using donation tips and affiliate marketing commissions from online retailers. (DAO treasury will hold the revenue and will use it to incentivize contributors)\n\n\n\n\nTransparency:\nSAY provides up to 4 receipts for every transaction. (bank/e-commerce/NGO/Delivery).\nMoreover, we know this is not enough!\nTransparency, community incentives, and globalizing SAY are why we are shifting it from a centralized organization to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization on the blockchain.\n\nWhy We Applied for Grant:\nWe have recently started to operate in Canada and building our network and product to collaborate with Canadian NGOs to create virtual families helping local children in the short run. However, we plan to collaborate with organizations operating in all countries to develop an international network of virtual families supporting millions of children in the long run.\n\n\nGitHub:

Stewards Network","slug":"dao-stewards-network","description":"WHY WE EXIST\r\nDAO Stewards Network (name TBD) is a network of DAO leaders (aka stewards) who will support and work with one another to co-create the future of DAOs and Web3.\r\nThis network will create online and IRL experiences for DAO leaders to connect, process the challenges they’re facing, coordinate their efforts, and create things that will benefit the whole ecosystem.\r\n\r\nWHAT WE WILL CREATE\r\nPotential outcomes of this network include: \r\nOpportunities to connect with other DAO leaders and have awesome, meaningful conversations about the things you care about;\r\nA trusted community that DAO summoners & leaders can turn to for information, guidance, or assistance;\r\nA group that can address emerging issues critical to the development of the ecosystem;\r\nThe creation of high-quality DAO-related content, developed collectively and shared publicly in a way that invites contributions from the broader community;\r\nCollective clarity on the shared language, values, and ethos that this community wants to promote (as well as a greater awareness of what key differences exist); \r\nNew or stronger mechanisms to increase diversity and inclusion in the field;\r\nA whole lot of stuff we haven’t even imagined yet!\r\n\r\nWHO WE ARE\r\nMembers of the DAO Stewards Network are people who are at the core of DAOs and who are doing important work in the ecosystem, pushing the culture of DAOs, and are key coordinators in the communities they’re involved in.\r\n\r\nPeople who have signaled interest & engaged so far include:\r\nAaron Soskin - Govrn, MetaCartel, Raid Guild\r\nAlex Zhang - Friends With Benefits\r\nChase Chapman - Decentology, Index Coop, Forefront, Rabbithole\r\nDavid Ehrlichman - DAOstewards network coordinator, Converge\r\nDavid Phelps - Ecodao, Gitcoin\r\nGary Sheng - DreamDAO\r\nJay Myers - DIA, Forefront, MetaFactory\r\nJess Sloss - Seed Club\r\nJihad Esmail - Syndicate Protocol, Forefront\r\nJon Hillis - CabinDAO\r\nJovian Browne - DiamondDAO, MetaGammaDelta\r\nJulia Lipton - DAO Masters\r\nJulia Rosenberg - ORCA Protocol\r\nLane Rettig - Spacemesh\r\nMagenta Ceiba - Bloom Network\r\nMatthew Chaim - Songcamp\r\nMetadreamer - MetaFactory, MetaGame, Sourcecred, MetaCartel Ventures, MetaCred, Coordinape\r\nMiaKoda Grodsky - YAP DAO\r\nNick Naraghi - EvenGov, DIA, Raid Guild\r\nNiran Babalola - Panvala, MetaCartel\r\nPeth - MetaGame, MetaCartel, DAOhaus, Raid Guild\r\nRafa - CabinDAO, Forefront\r\nSirsu - The Well, Mint Fund, BLVKHVND\r\nScott Moore - Gitcoin, KERNEL, Seed Club, PleasrDAO\r\nSpencer Graham - DAOhaus, Raid Guild\r\nStefen Deleveaux - Caribbean Blockchain Alliance, The DAOist, HerstoryDAO\r\nTina He - STATION\r\nTracheopteryx - Yearn, Coordinape\r\nVen - MetaCartel, DIA, DAOhaus, RaidGuild, MolochDAO\r\nZach Anderson - Coordinape, Converge\r\n\r\nWHO STARTED IT\r\nSome of the people from the above provided the initial spark back at MCON, where they talked about the need for having a place where DAO leaders connect & talk about the challenges they're facing pushing forward at this weird new DAO frontier.\r\nIt's a collective effort with David Erlichman as the main coordinator/cat herder, a man with some serious experience in building pre-DAO DAOs, communities & impact networks - even wrote a book on it.\r\n\r\nWHAT WE DO\r\nOver the coming weeks & months, we will be holding conversations around anything & everything related to DAOs on topics such as diversity, inclusion & access; values & norms; ecosystem cooperation & sustainability; incentives and compensation; and DAO systems and properties.\r\n\r\nBesides facilitating online conversations, there will be work required to onboard new people into the network, convene the network both virtually and IRL (approximately once per quarter), general coordination & facilitation, mapping the network, documenting conversations & creating educational content.\r\n\r\nWHY WE NEED MONEY\r\nWe are 100% intrinsically driven to participate & have these conversations, but we need resources to make the less exciting & more laborious work around general coordination, documentation & content creation sustainable long term.","reference_url":"https://nowebsiteyet.sorry","logo":null,"admin_address":"0xa5fb245acdF6A08AD8Fa47b542a30068316Fb2a1","amount_received":"2.0000","token_address":"0x0","token_symbol":"Any

- Aggregate your private reputation to your public Ethereum profile","slug":"sismo-aggregate-your-private-reputation-to-your-p","description":"The Sismo Genesis team is proud to have been invited to join the \"ZK Tech\" match pool of the 12th Gitcoin grant round. More info about the Gitcoin ZK Tech grant funding: here.\n\nWhat is Sismo?\n\nSismo builds up your Ethereum profile with anonymised attestations created from your other accounts.\n\nSismo issues badges (as non-transferable ERC-1155 NFTs) to your public Ethereum profiles (ENS names). These badges are Zero-Knowledge (ZK) attestations of facts imported from your other private accounts (Ethereum accounts as well as Twitter or GitHub). You can aggregate your reputation, with confidentiality, to your public profile without revealing any of your private addresses.\n\n\n\nContext\n\nWith 10 million MAUs reached by MetaMask last August1, 2021 marked a turning point for Ethereum in mainstream adoption with a younger and less tech-savvy user base entering the scene via DeFi and NFTs. We are going towards a mainstream use of wallets. \nMany Ethereum users manage multiple accounts; most of them have private accounts (*89%) and public accounts (*64% have ENS) that they sometimes display on Twitter. They make sure that no public link exists between their addresses to protect their privacy (*73%).\n\nA consequence is that users have their history and reputation fragmented over multiple accounts.\n\nThis is a waste in the world of open and interoperable protocols, where we are accustomed to reuse everything (e.g idle assets bear yield, most tokens bear governance power, most NFT bear rights, actions can give retroactive rights).\n\n\n\nUse cases to be unlocked by Sismo:\nPrivate Token-gated communities\nSybil Resistance\nTargeted and fair airdrops\nCredit or Degen scoring\nMarketplace reputation\nAnd so much more...\n\nWebsite:\nhttps://sismo.io/\n\nSocials\n• Twitter: https://twitter.com/Sismo_eth\n• Discord: https://discord.gg/nHFnt4TdZd\n• Blog:

MMORPG built on Polygon. There have been many committed users from within the community that have strived to produce quality, informative content. This is our attempt to focus and empower these true #GotchiGang supporters and create one of Aavegotchi's earliest specialized interest groups.\n\nOur members provide a wealth of content creation for Aavegotchi across varying mediums and anticipate expanding to even more media channels as our ranks, skillsets and coverage increase. We currently produce material for podcasts, youtube, twitter spaces and twitch via the following early member productions:\n\tThe GotchiCaast \n\tMusic City Gotchi Gang\n\tAavegotchi Pacific Chapter\n    Goalden Road\n    Gotchi Creator Community\n    Roxiano-Gotchi\n\nThis grant request is to aid in the genesis establishment of the Gotchiverse Media International creators coalition treasury and will bootstrap one of the earliest emerging community operated industries. These funds will be placed in a multi-sig vault and staked in DeFi positions to generate yields that will be utilized for coalition expenses such as production equipment and making frens. At the very least, please take a moment to enjoy some of our dedicated members content.

Lines Community","slug":"blurred-lines-community","description":"Blurred Lines is a Web3 community from The Continent and Black diaspora who color outside the lines, get alternative and embrace the experimental. The community started in Clubhouse rooms in November 2020 and it is now a cross platform community that amplifies the next global tastemakers in the culture. This year, the community was highlighted in Billboard Magazine's Change Agents List and NYLON Magazine. We have consistent weekly scheduled programming, curated playlists, NFT drop parties, onboarding sessions to Metamask/ENS/POAP, and panels featuring members of the community with major label presidents and mainstream international musicians. The community is active on Clubhouse, Twitter and Discord. The discord is a safe space to share music, NFTs, job opportunities, grants, events, manifestations, Web3 onboarding, VC pitching, and news related to international music, fashion, DeFI, and 3D avatars. The discord is not currently token gated, but once our tokens are minted, we'll create a way to make it still accessible but a hub to earn our tokens for contributing to the community and the culture. The community was founded by Melanie McClain, a New York based music industry industry alum. She is Black woman who has worked as hip-hop and African music playlist curator for YouTube Music, publishing A&R at Secretly Group, music experiential manager at Budweiser and social media associate at Pitchfork. She has worked directly with Lizzo, G-Eazy, Burna Boy, Roddy Ricch, Haviah Mighty, Lady Donli, J Balvin and more. Melanie is also has been a member of the crypto community for 4 years and active in communities like Bored Ape Yacht Club, Black NFT Art, FWB, Felt Zine, and Protein. A grant for Blurred Lines will go to building a social token economy for the community that ties into concert residencies in Decentraland, music and wearable fashion NFT collaborations, and IRL meet up events in Ghana, Lisbon, New York and Miami. The past year, the community has numerous examples of supporting musicians who have gone to chart on the Billboard chart and receive Grammy nominations like Tems (see: \"Essence\" featuring Wizkid and Amaarae). Plans for the community include meet & greets and custom merch for members of the community who earn a certain amount of tokens and building new products that help the needs to members of the community who have trouble claiming NFTs or minting due to issues related to data and access to wifi.
