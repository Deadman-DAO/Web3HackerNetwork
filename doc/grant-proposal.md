# Part 1 - Proposal

## Name of Project: *DeadmanDAO Web3 Hacker Network*

## Proposal in one sentence

Create a decentralized network analytics data pipeline for discovering Web3 hackers and understanding the developer-developer multinetwork.

## Description of the project and what problem it is solving

## Grant Deliverables

## Project Category: *Unleash Data*

## Earmark: *New Project*

## What is the final product?

The first iteration final product will include two user experiences. First, people who have worked on Gitcoin projects will be able to enter their login and the skill they are seeking, and will be shown the optimal graph paths to neighbors who have that skill. Second, there will be a periodically updated set of analytical charts and statistics about the Web3 Hacker Network, showing things like [TBK], [TBK], and [TBK].

This will be backed by a decentralized data pipeline. Stage 1 will have raw data about developer history and projects pulled from Gitcoin. Stage 2 will process that data to create a set of developer-developer sparse matrices with the edge weight representing number of shared projects and each matrix representing a particular skill set. Stage 3 will incorporate that data into a NetworkX model representing the multinetwork of Web3 hackers. The UX will use the NetworkX model as its backend.

The longer term final product will evolve organically based on feedback, demand, and developer engagement. Potential features include incorporating data from other Web3 connection services like Discord, richer analytics metrics and charts, more complex querying of the multinetwork model, actively marketing the datasets, enabling users to attach metadata to their node, and partnership outreach to connection services. We will also be considering the economics of running a forked marketplace.

## Which value add criteria are we focusing on? Why do we believe we will do well?

option 1: Usage of Ocean - how well might the project drive usage of Ocean. Measure with e.g. Data Consume Volume, # assets published, TVL (total value locked), Network Revenue, # active users, # funded projects.

option 2: Viability - what is the chance of success of the project

option 3: community active-ness - how active is the team in the community

option 4: Adding value to the overall community - how well does the outcome of the project add value to the Ocean community / ecosystem

## Funding Requested: *$USD* (new team: max $3000)

## Proposal Wallet Address: *[TBK, will my Coinbase-hosted wallet work?]* (must have 500 OCEAN in wallet, must be an Ethereum wallet)

## Have you previously received an OceanDAO Grant?: *No*

# Part 3 - Proposal Details

## 3.1 Details

Details of the proposal - 1 or more paragraphs

## 3.4 Which Ocean-powered data market will data be published on?

[TBK: Ummm, which what? :) - I think: Ocean Market with plans to investigate the RoI of forking our own market]

## 3.7.a. Are there any mockups or designs to date?

[TBK: we should have a basic pipeline diagram, at least]

[TBK: we should have a primitive user interface mockup]

[TBK: we should have a couple network analytics metrics / charts to show]

## 3.7.b. Please give an overview of the technology stack.

[TBK: Gitcoin API -> raw data -> sparse matrices -> NewtorkX -> UX ]
