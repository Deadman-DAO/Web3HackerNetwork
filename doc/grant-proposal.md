# Part 1 - Proposal

## Name of Project: *DeadmanDAO Web3 Hacker Network*

## Proposal in one sentence

Create a decentralized data science system to help hackers, teams, and projects to find each other.

## Description of the project and what problem it is solving

Finding Web3 developers to work with on bounties, hackathons, and grants is challenging. You can go to Discord and post, but your reach will be limited. You can search on LinkedIn, but that data is often stale or aspirational. Web3 Hacker Network will provide analytics about the network of people who are building Web3.

It can be challenging to scale a team for a project without the costly HR departments used to grow engineering departments in Web2. DeadmanDAO is beginning down the road toward facilitating decentralized talent mobility.

## Grant Deliverables [Update TBD]

* Raw dataset from GitHub with data regarding some initial Web3 projects for analysis.
* Metrics from the cloned repository for each of the initial project regarding commits, committers, and file types.
* Data exploration showing potential features for inclusion in an initial multi-label classification model for commits.
* Initial manual labeling of some example commits.
* Baseline F1 score for a simple regression model.
* Analysis of the dataset and model to assess fitness to task and gaps to be filled.

## Project Category: *Unleash Data*

## Earmark: *New Project*

## What is the final product?

Web3 Hacker Network is a data science system incorporating network, regression, clustering, and classification models to increase tech talent mobility in Web3. The final product is a decentralized autonomous opportunity discovery engine for hackers, backers, projects, and teams. It will provide some of the services of hiring managers and HR departments from Web2, but in a fashion that is more aligned with the decentralized and self-service nature of Web3.

Web2 notions of long employment with a single firm are breaking down. In Web3 hackers are working across more projects for shorter periods of time, resulting in greater innovation through increased cross-pollination of ideas. Opportunity discovery and resource placement in this more dynamic environment will have to move faster and cost less than Web2 HR-driven hiring pipelines.

Network theory, machine learning, and the open data about work history in Web3 allows for automated opportunity discovery. Web3 Hacker Network is breaking ground on a long-term project that will serve hackers, backers, projects, and teams. The final product will present users with a menu of opportunities that match their role in the ecosystem and preferences for developing their professional life.

## Which value add criteria are we focusing on? Why do we believe we will do well?

### option 1: Usage of Ocean
- how well might the project drive usage of Ocean. Measure with e.g. Data Consume Volume, # assets published, TVL (total value locked), Network Revenue, # active users, # funded projects.

Network Revenue: Our first iteration focused on Gitcoin data, we are now adding GitHub data. Gitcoin grants and bounties have totalled more than $10m in the past 12 months, with a steady baseline around $500k/month. For many years GitHub has been the center of orders of magnitude more value creation across Web2 and Web3. Our dataset and compute will have an influence on total productivity in the millions to tens of millions per month.

The value of improved talent mobility can be estimated by headhunter service fees, which range from 20 - 25%. Our automated system will not provide all the services of HR departments or headhunters, but they will act more objectively. If it provides one quarter of the value of a headhunter, that suggests it will improve productivity by 5% of millions to tens of millions. That puts it in the vicinity of $500k per month of value creation.

Gitcoin provides core data on active hackers in Web3, GitHub will add more data about their work history and expose more information about early and potential Web3 hackers. The road ahead includes adding data from blockchain analytics providers and grant funders like MolochDAO, Harmony, and Genesis DAO.

And this is only the beginning. We expect Web3 to surpass Web2 in the long run, and for dynamic team composition to be the new normal. There will be hundreds of millions of dollars worth of human resource assignments happening every month. Tools like this one will be responsible for millions of dollars in increased talent placement efficiency per month.

### option 2: Viability
- what is the chance of success of the project

Our data engineering and data science person built Spark-based DE and ML systems at Amazon on terabyte datasets, then managed a team doing the same through several deliveries on time and on budget. Our React engineer designed and delivered US DoD warehouse automation systems on strict timelines and budgets.

Over the coming months and iterations we will need to expand the team to deliver the larger vision. Our lead grew a team at Amazon from 3 people to 12 people in one year while delivering on an aggressive project schedule. His ability to find the right people, build team spirit, and motivate enthusiastic engagement were the core of his success.

There is always risk, and this is a highly exploratory project. Nothing is guaranteed, but our core team is strong and the data we need is available.

### option 4: Adding value to the overall community
- how well does the outcome of the project add value to the Ocean community / ecosystem

The long-term project will be integral to the work cycle of a significant portion of Web3 producers. This product will expose a large number of active Web3 hackers and team builders to Ocean Protocol.

# Part 3 - Proposal Details [revision TBD]

## 3.1 Details

We propose extending our data pipeline to include GitHub data in addition to our existing Gitcoin data, and to publish the datasets on Ocean Protocol. We will also do an initial iteration on feature and target engineering toward clustering and regression models. Two engineers will be involved during this iteration. Future iterations will expand the project based on discovery, demand, feedback, and developer engagement.

## 3.4 Which Ocean-powered data market will data be published on?

Initial deployment will be on Ocean Market. In subsequent rounds we will explore the RoI of forking our own market. We have system administration experience, so it's just a question of where we want to allocate our time during each iteration.

## 3.9 Project Deliverables - Roadmap

### Any prior work completed thus far? Details?

We pulled the data from Gitcoin and created a relational database schema. We did initial network analysis using NetworkX which led us to shift our priorities for this iteration toward regression and clustering as the shortest path to making placement recommendations.

Network density measures showed a strongly connected subnetwork in the Gitcoin data that was based on trivial bounties like Proof of Attendance Protocal bounties for attending a video lecture. Connections based on such bounties are limited in their ability to show significant similarity between the participants.

GitHub data includes project participation, commits, bug reports, project creation, and other substantial measures of a person's productive work. We will start with a transformer to provide an embedding that expresses the meaning of a commit. This will be the first foundation block for a transfer learning model that will combine embeddings for key behaviors on GitHub to build a multi-label classification or embedding for a person that expresses all the dimensions of their work.

#### 3.9.1: Gitcoin Bounty ERD

1. Milestone 1 (End of Week 1): GitHub API connection. Initial dataset calls. Document potential features and targets for regression model.
1. Milestone 2 (End of Week 2): Spider GitHub API to secondary dataset. Begin feature and target exploration from initial dataset.
1. Milestone 3 (End of Week 3): Spider to remaining GitHub API calls for this iteration. Expand feature and target exploration.
1. Milestone 4 (End of Week 4): GitHub ERD refinement and documentation. Begin analytics on select features and targets.
1. Milestone 5 (End of Week 5): Complete GitHub ERD documentation. Document feature and target findings.
1. Milestone 6 (End of Week 6): [TBD] Expose the UX for querying the network.
1. Milestone 7 (End of week 7): [TBD] Refine wiki documentation for public consumption and announce.
1. Milestone 8 (End of week 8): [TBD] Write the grant for Ocean Round 17.

### What is the team's future plans and intentions?

We intend to continue extending the work as long as we are gaining traction and improving talent mobility.

## 3.10 Additional Information

I intend to submit a grant to Gitcoin at the same time that I submit to Ocean Protocol.
