# Proposal: *DeadmanDAO Web3 Hacker Network*

## Name of Project: *Web3 Hacker Network*

## Proposal in one sentence

Create a decentralized network analytics data pipeline for discovering Web3 hackers.

## Description of the project and what problem it is solving

## Grant Deliverables

## Project Category: *Unleash Data*

## Earmark: *New Project*

## What is the final product?

The first iteration final product will include two user experiences. First, people who have worked on Gitcoin projects will be able to enter their login and the skill they are seeking, and will be shown the optimal graph paths to neighbors who have that skill. Second, there will be a periodically updated set of analytical charts and statistics about the Web3 Hacker Network, showing things like [TBK], [TBK], and [TBK].

This will be backed by a decentralized data pipeline. Stage 1 will have raw data about developer history and projects pulled from Gitcoin. Stage 2 will process that data to create a set of developer-developer sparse matrices with the edge weight representing number of shared projects and each matrix representing a particular skill set. Stage 3 will incorporate that data into a NetworkX model representing the multinetwork of Web3 hackers. The UX will use the NetworkX model as its backend.

The longer term final product will evolve organically based on feedback, demand, and developer engagement. Potential features include incorporating data from other Web3 connection services like Discord, richer analytics metrics and charts, more complex querying of the multinetwork model, actively marketing the datasets, enabling users to attach metadata to their node, and partnership outreach to connection services. We will also be considering the economics of running a forked marketplace.

## Which value add criteria are we focusing on? Why do we believe we will do well?

option 1: Usage of Ocean - how well might the project drive usage of Ocean. Measure with e.g. Data Consume Volume, # assets published, TVL (total value locked), Network Revenue, # active users, # funded projects.
