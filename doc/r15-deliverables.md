Please note that we were edged out by some compelling competition in Round 15. While we did not receive a grant, we continued working toward our long-term goals. Our effort was not focused on these deliverables and we narrowed our scope, but our output was still aligned with the R15 grant proposal.

* Raw dataset showing Gitcoin user participation in bounties, hackathons, and grants.
    * MariaDB Database Dump: https://public-webdump.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/deadmandao/dump-deadmandao-gitcoin-202203301611.sql.bz2
* User-User sparse matrix dataset showing strength of association between Web3 hackers.

* NetworkX model of the network representing the user-user edges.
    * GitHub Commit: https://github.com/Deadman-DAO/Web3HackerNetwork/commit/99896ffa80774bf21f16812e497a651acd2f70cc
* Initial analysis of the dataset and model to assess fitness to task and gaps to be filled.
    * Analysis Doc: https://github.com/Deadman-DAO/Web3HackerNetwork/blob/main/doc/r15-network-analysis.md
* User experience that takes a Gitcoin ID and finds the network path to nearby or strongly connected hackers.
    * We dropped this requirement to reduce scope.
