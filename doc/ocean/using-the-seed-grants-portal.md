# Using the OceanDao Seed Grants Portal

## Overview

Until Grant Round 15, OceanDao grant proposals were posted to the Ocean Protocol Discourse forum. While Discourse is a fine product, OceanDao has developed a portal that is more supportive in long-term management of projects and grants. The most significant new feature is that projects are managed independently of grant proposals. If you will be working with Ocean Protocal for the long haul, this will make your returning visits much easier.

This guide will walk you through creating a project and grant proposal.

## Prerequisites

### Wallet(s)

You will need wallets to fulfill two purposes for your project. One will act as the identity of the project manager, allowing you to create projects and grant proposals, and to submit deliverables for review. The other will act as the identity of your financial person, holding the 500 OCEAN required to be a grant participant and receiving grant funding in the event that your proposal is selected.

#### Project Management Wallet

Your project management wallet must be compatible with WalletConnect. You can find all the compatible wallets on the [WalletConnect website](https://walletconnect.com/registry?type=wallet). This wallet does not need to contain any currency, and for the purpose of segregation of duties, it may be more secure to have a separate wallet dedicated to this purpose.

***Should there be a section here with recommended wallets?*** I'm pretty new to Web3, and the list of wallets on the WalletConnect website was pretty daunting. I'm also risk averse - wallets seem like fertile ground for scammers. Having some recommended wallets might be nice - but at the same time I understand if Ocean wants to avoid the appearance of picking winners and losers.

#### Finance Wallet

Your finance wallet needs to contain 500 OCEAN. OCEAN is the OceanDao [ERC2 token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC20). Most self-managed Ethereum wallets support ERC20 tokens like OCEAN. An example of the difference between a hosted and self-managed wallet is [Coinbase.com versus Coinbase Wallet](https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/getting-started/what-s-the-difference-between-coinbase-com-and-wallet).

Like your project management wallet, it may help improve security if you use a separate wallet to store your OCEAN currency from the one that you use for project management. That will also let you delegate finance and project management to separate people as your organization grows.

***Should there be a section here with recommended wallets?*** I'm pretty new to Web3, and the number of Ethereum wallets is staggering.

## Connecting to seed.oceandao.org

Once you have your wallets ready to go, head to [seed.oceandao.org](https://seed.oceandao.org) to create your project. It should show you a QR code. If it doesn't, click on Connect and it will pop up. Scan the code with your wallet app, and it will ask you to authorized the connection.

Be sure to keep your wallet app open and your cell phone handy. You'll receive new authorization requests for each significant event you perform, like creating a project or updating a grant proposal.

### Existing Project Teams

If you have submitted grant proposals in the past and your wallet is WalletConnect compatible, you can connect using that wallet and your past project(s) should be visible on the home page.

If you have submitted grant proposals in the past from a wallet that is not compatible with WalletConnect, reach out to the Ocean team on Discord at [#project-guiding](https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016658239610920). They can help you with connecting your earlier round proposals to your new wallet.

## Projects Versus Grant Proposals

If you're familiar with the grant process from R15 and earlier, you might be surprised at how few data fields are in the Project form. That is because projects have been separated from grant proposals. You can now create one project that refers to your long-term objectives, and create individual grants for rounds of funding that support individual iterations toward your long term goal. No more re-entering all your project information for each round of work.

## Creating a New Project

If you don't have an existing project, you can create a new one by clicking on "Create Project" on the [seed.oceandao.org](https://seed.oceandao.org) home page. The app will guide you through the process.

Be sure to have your cell phone handy with your WalletConnect app open and connected to the Seed Grants portal. When you click "Create Project" on the second page of the New Project form, it will send an authorization request to your wallet that you will need to sign in your wallet app.
