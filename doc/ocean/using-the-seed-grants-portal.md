# Using the OceanDao Seed Grants Portal

## Overview

Before Grant Round 16, OceanDao grant proposals were posted to the Ocean Protocol Discourse forum. OceanDao has now developed a portal that is more supportive of long-term management for projects and grants. Wallet-based authorization keeps your projects and grants secure, and projects are now managed independently of grant proposals. If you will be working with Ocean Protocol for the long haul, this will make your returning visits much easier.

This guide will walk you through creating a project and grant proposal.

## Prerequisites

### Wallet(s)

You will need a wallet to fulfill two purposes for your project. One will act as the identity of the project manager, allowing you to create projects and grant proposals, and to submit deliverables for review. The other will handle your crypto tokens, holding the 500 OCEAN required to be a grant participant and receiving grant funding in the event that your proposal is selected.

You can use one wallet for both tasks, but for increased security and organizational flexibility, you may want to consider using two different wallets. This provides "segregation of duties" which limits the blast radius of security breaches, and allows you to delegate financial and project management to different people as your organization grows.

#### Project Management Wallet

Your project management wallet must be compatible with WalletConnect. You can find all the compatible wallets on the [WalletConnect website](https://walletconnect.com/registry?type=wallet).

This is the wallet you will use to authorize all your project management work on the Ocean Seed Grants portal, so keep your cell phone handy and your wallet connected while you are managing your projects and grants.

#### Finance Wallet

Your finance wallet needs to contain 500 OCEAN. OCEAN is the OceanDao [ERC2 token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC20). Most self-managed Ethereum wallets support ERC20 tokens like OCEAN. An example of the difference between a hosted and self-managed wallet is [Coinbase.com versus Coinbase Wallet](https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/getting-started/what-s-the-difference-between-coinbase-com-and-wallet).

This is the wallet address that you will include on your Grant Proposal in the field named "Proposal Wallet Address."

## Connecting to seed.oceandao.org

Once you have your wallets ready to go, head to [seed.oceandao.org](https://seed.oceandao.org) to create your project. It should show you a QR code. If it doesn't, click on Connect and it will pop up. Scan the code with your wallet app, and it will ask you to authorize the connection.

Be sure to keep your project management wallet app open and your cell phone handy. You'll receive new authorization requests for each significant event you perform, like creating a project or updating a grant proposal.

### Existing Project Teams

If you have submitted grant proposals in the past and your wallet is WalletConnect compatible, you can connect using that wallet and your past project(s) should be visible on the home page.

If you have submitted grant proposals in the past from a wallet that is not compatible with WalletConnect, reach out on the Ocean Discord server at [#project-guiding](https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016658239610920). They can help you with connecting your earlier round proposals to your new wallet.

## Projects Versus Grant Proposals

If you're familiar with the grant process from R15 and earlier, you might be surprised at how few data fields are in the New Project form. That is because projects have been separated from grant proposals. You can now create one project that refers to your long-term objectives, and create individual grants for rounds of funding that support individual iterations toward your long term goals.

## Creating a New Project

If you don't have an existing project, you can create a new one by clicking on "Create Project" on the [seed.oceandao.org](https://seed.oceandao.org) home page. The app will guide you through the process.

Be sure to have your cell phone handy with your WalletConnect app open and connected to the Seed Grants portal. When you click "Create Project" on the second page of the New Project form, it will send an authorization request to your wallet app that you will need to sign.

## Updating Your Project

Once your project is created, you can edit it any time by clicking on "View" under the project name on the [seed.oceandao.org](https://seed.oceandao.org) home page. This will walk you through the same steps as creating a new project, but with the exiting content already filled in.

![Portal Projects Page](https://github.com/Deadman-DAO/Web3HackerNetwork/blob/main/doc/ocean/portal-projects-page.png "Portal Projects Page")

As with all the tasks you complete in the portal, when you submit your update, you will have to check your wallet app for the authorization request.

## Creating a Proposal

Once you have a project created, you can attach a proposal to it. You can only have one proposal for each grant round, and you must submit your deliverables for prior rounds (see Submitting Deliverables, below) before creating a new grant proposal.

Starting from the [seed.oceandao.org](https://seed.oceandao.org) home page, click "View" on the project to which you will add a new proposal. Under the Proposals section, you can click "Create Proposal" to start a new proposal for the upcoming grant round. The app will show you a one-page form to fill out, with a "Submit Proposal" button at the bottom.

![Portal Existing Project Page](https://github.com/Deadman-DAO/Web3HackerNetwork/blob/main/doc/ocean/portal-project-create-proposal-page.png "Portal Existing Project")

If you are using separate wallets for financial and project management, be sure to use your financial wallet address in the Proposal field called "Proposal Wallet Address."

When you submit, you will recieve a signing request in your project management wallet app. Keep your phone handy and sign it when it comes through.

## Updating a Proposal

Just like projects, you can use the Seed Grants portal to update your grant proposals after you create them. Starting from the [seed.oceandao.org](https://seed.oceandao.org) home page, click "View" on the project to which you will add a new proposal. Scroll down to the Proposals section, find the grant you want to update, and click "View". From the proposal screen you have several options for updates.

![Portal View Proposal Page](https://github.com/Deadman-DAO/Web3HackerNetwork/blob/main/doc/ocean/portal-view-proposal.png "Portal View Proposal Page")

First, you can Withdraw your proposal. Please be careful with this one. Once a proposal is withdrawn, it cannot be restored. As with all actions, you will need to sign an authorization request to complete the withdrawal.

Second, you can Update your proposal. This will walk you through the same form you used to create your proposal, but it will have the existing information filled in on the form. When you complete the update form and submit it, check your wallet app for the authorization request.

Finally, you can submit deliverables for your proposal. Deliverables are covered in the next section.

## Submitting Deliverables

Starting from the [seed.oceandao.org](https://seed.oceandao.org) home page, click "View" on the project for which you are submitting deliverables. On the project page, find the proposal you have been working on and click "View" on it. That will take you to the proposal page where you can click on "Submit Deliverables."

The submit deliverables form will present you with the list of deliverables from your grant proposal. Under each bullet point, add brief notes or links that explain the work that you have completed. If you keep things brief, with links to drill down to more detail, it will make it easier for your reviewer(s) to confirm your deliverables.

![Portal Deliverables Page](https://github.com/Deadman-DAO/Web3HackerNetwork/blob/main/doc/ocean/portal-submit-deliverables.png "Portal Deliverables Page")

Once you submit the deliverables they will go to review, so please complete all the bullet points before you click Submit. This will allow your reviewer(s) to complete your review quickly and without having to redo their work.

As with the other tasks above, when you click Submit, you will have to check your wallet app and sign the authorization request.
