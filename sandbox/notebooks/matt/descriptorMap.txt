  "rust": "Rust shows a Gaussian distribution in this histogram.\nThe scatter plot shows positive correlation between the number of files checked in and the number of lines of Rust code.",
  "json": "JSON shows a gap on both histogram and scatter plot.  I think that this is due to the variety in usage of the JSON data storage/transfer protocol.",
  "javascript": "JavaScript shows a stronger normal distribution and more positive correlation than JSON.  One outlier throws off the graph range to some extent.",
  "markdown": "From the histogram we see fairly normal distribution for markdown (.md) files.  The scatter plot appears less supportive of positive correlation at this point.",
  "html": "HTML appears to be a stronger contendant for both distribution and direct correlation.",
  "lock": "Within our selective data set, the number of lines in .lock files appears to have a strong correlation with the number of files committed.",
  "yarn": "Yarn is a good example of nearly zero correlation and can thusly be excluded from usage in later analysis."
